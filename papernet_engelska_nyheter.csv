According to information from Eurostat, the Statistical Office of the European Communities, electricity prices for industrial users in the EU rose by 25 percent and gas prices by 50 percent between  January 2005 and January 2006.In the tissue making process, electricity runs machine drives pump and fans. Gas/steam is used for drying. The higher the consistency of the sheet after the press, the less energy consumed to dry it.In the interests of reducing energy consumption, water consumption is also of importance.At the Tissue World in Nice Metso presented currently available technologies that enable tissue makers to combat price increases by reducing electricity and gas/steam as well as water consumption.The OptiRefine RF, featuring improved refiner segments, reduces power consumption by 30 to 50 percent depending on fiber mix. This decreases energy consumption for tissue-line refining by 25 to 40 kWh/ton.The OptiFlo II TIS reduces headbox flow by 20 percent, which also cuts fan pump energy consumption by 20 percent. On high-speed machines, fan pump energy amounts to more than 50 percent of the total machine drive load. Compared with standard headboxes, the OptiFlo II TIS can decrease energy consumption on these machines by 40 to 60 KWh/ton.",Engelska nyheter

""A reality for Stora Enso and the European forest products industry is

the worsening shortage of wood supply, resulting from announced higher

Russian export duties, the increasing use of wood fibre as biofuel, and

the rising environmental pressures to limit the procurement of wood raw

material. As we have announced, we have agreed not to buy wood from

Metsähallitus from disputed areas in northern Finland for now, but

there is no way we can produce pulp without sufficient wood supply”

39175.5510069444,Eloranta expects profitable growth to continue,"At Metso Corporation's Annual General Meeting being held today, President and CEO Jorma Eloranta estimates in his review that Metso's profitable growth will continue also in 2007. The good order intake in the first quarter supports the positive development for full year. ","""As we noted in February, in connection with the publication of our

Financial Statements, Metso's net sales in 2007 are estimated to grow

by more than 20 percent on 2006, and the operating profit is estimated

to clearly improve. We also repeat our estimate regarding the 2007

operating profit margin: It is estimated that the operating profit

margin will be slightly below Metso's 10 percent target. Metso's order

backlog has further strengthened from the year-end, which supports our

favorable full-year estimate""

 

However, Eloranta reminds that in businesses like Metso's the net sales

and operating profit can vary significantly between quarters: ""We

estimate that this year the first quarter will be the weakest, and the

net sales and operating profit for the last three quarters of the year

will clearly improve from the first quarter. This is mainly due to the

timing and mix of deliveries and normal seasonal variation,"" Eloranta

says.

 

According to Eloranta, continuous improvement of productivity and

operational quality are key matters for profitability development.

Additionally, Metso is developing its business processes and supporting

information systems.

 

""Growth will also require business renewal. We see great potential in,

for example, environmental and service business development,"" Eloranta

says. Metso will also consider corporate acquisitions that complement

its current product and service offering or strengthen its geographical

presence. ",Engelska nyheter

Stockholm to discuss Al Gores book, An Inconvenient Truth. Wallström

done. 

“I hope Europe will continue to take the lead by clear targets,

investing in technology and partnerships between counties and

politicians”, said Wallström.

The former vice president was optimistic on the possibility of combating climate change.

“I believe we are going to solve it,” said Gore.

He also said that the US climate politics might change in the near future. 

“We are seeing the beginning of a shift. Even though Bush is not

changing, the congress is now changing. Our states are not waiting for

the national government”, he said.

But the message was clear, something has to be done. 

“The existence of global warming is now a consensus. The effects that

39182.4643981482,Highest profitability closest to end-customer,"Ernst & Young’s study of the paper industry reflects an industry undergoing major change. Higher and fluctuating energy prices, consolidation trends, changed demand and the possibilities and risks of moving into new markets are factors that impact the industry heavily.","In its survey, Ernst & Young interviewed leading representatives of

the pulp and paper industry in 12 countries about how they view the

industry’s future.

The survey reveals that the pulp and paper industry has posted poor

profitability in the past four years, with a few exceptions. Among

others, Holmen, Mondi and Mayr-Melnhof reported favorable

profitability. The reason is that they have established positions in

certain product niches. The producers of solely pulp also report

relatively high profitability.  The highest profitability is among

paper producers close to the end-customer.

In interviews with 36 opinion leaders and company executives regarding

the industry’s future, it was revealed that the balance between supply

and demand is the greatest challenge, followed by rising capacity in

growth countries. Some 90 percent of those questioned consider that the

industry must invest substantially more in research and development

than is the case today and that the industry is moving toward a slow

consolidation. Many pulp and paper manufacturers are integrating

forward in the value chain, that is, entering alliances with players

closer to the end-customer, where profitability is greater. 

“The industry will invest substantially more in productivity enhancing

measures and the consolidation trend is distinct although slow within

the industry. A typical example is SCA’s acquisition of Proctor &

Gamble’s tissue production in Europe,” comments Ulf Borgcrantz,

Stora Enso a total of 250 hectares of industrial land for possible

future use as a mill site. The mill site is by the sea in the

Tieshangang Industrial Zone of Beihai City in the north of Beibu Gulf

January-March 2007, compared with the year before. Growth was

overshadowed by concern about the availability of wood raw material at

competitive price, however, as the forest industries' demand for

domestic wood is continuously increasing. ","At the same time the production of bioenergy raises demand for wood and forest biomass and thus competition for raw materials.

39218.4719791667,New grinding concept for rolls developed,"Voith Paper has developed a new grinding concept for rolls, called 3DG. According to Voith, the concept can reduce roll problems such as vibrations or barring that shorten the standing.","3DG starts with a precise three-dimensional measurement of the roll

surface and journals. Following the measurement phase, a

three-dimensional comparison of existing and targeted values of the

roll outline is conducted, and problematic parts are identified. Due to

the dynamical activation of the grinding disc, only those predefined

parts of the roll will be grinded. Any form defects of the journals

will not be transferred to the roll surface, thus an excellent

roundness is realized.

Voith Paper Rolls in Wimpassing, Austria, has successfully implemented

3DG. During the summer this year, another 3DG grinding machine will be

brought on line at the Voith Paper Rolls Service Center in Laakirchen,

39220.4141203704,The forest industry - a locomotive of success,"The forest industry could very well become Europe’s leading industrial locomotive. That was the conclusion of an EU working group chaired by Esko Aho, presented at the Future Lead Markets of the Forest-based Sector conference, which was held in Hannover on in the beginning of the week.","“Innovations are a key operating model through which research and

development investments can generate revenues,” said the Finnish former

Prime Minister Esko Aho, President of the Finnish National Fund for

Research and Development, in a speech at the Future Lead Markets of the

Forest-based Sector conference. 

An EU working group chaired by Esko Aho has been looking at ways to

improve the European environment for research and innovation. The

working group has published a report titled Creating an Innovative

Europe. Aho thinks Europe’s strength lies in well-educated consumers

who have the ability and opportunity to adopt, for example, new

technologies and web-based services. Developing new products to fulfil

the needs of customers should form the core idea in all product

development activities.

“We cannot match the USA or Japan in product development investments,

but a superior competitive advantage for us is that the majority of

Europeans live in a modern, information-based society. China, for

example, has a long way to go in this respect,” Aho said. Customers

should be the focus of all activities, not just the final link in the

product development chain.

Aho was pleased with the European forest sector’s ability to get all of

its central actors together to define shared visions and a common

research strategy under the Forest-based Sector Technology Platform

project. The forest sector of Europe has an excellent possibility to

become the leading locomotive for industry in our continent because it

uses renewable natural resources and operates sustainable. The forest

sector considers it important that the availability of wood is

safeguarded and the value of its products increased through research

and product development inputs.

Aho said Europe should bring its intellectual capital to the fore. “The

possibilities of funding innovation are increasing, thanks to, for

example, the EU Structural Fund,” he said.

39238.3793055556,Lack of aspen,"The increasing competition from bio energy producers,

combined with the threat of Russian export tariffs, has caused the

price on aspen to rise.","Rottneros has raised the prices on aspen wood with nearly 20 percent this year, from 205 SEK per cubic metre to 245 SEK, in order to entice forest owners to sort out more aspen wood, according to the magazine Skogsland.- Aspen is a small selection in Sweden, but the Rottneros group uses a great deal, about 400 000 cubic metres a year. The aim is to have a price that makes it profitable for the forest owners to sort out aspen, says Ingemar Eliasson, raw material director of the Rottneros Group to Skogsland. Rottneros uses aspen to make CTMP pulp at the mills in Utansjö, Rottneros and Rockhammar. Two thirds of the aspen wood that Rottneros consumes is imported, mostly from the Baltic countries, but also from Russia. Since Russia has announced a gradual raise of the export tariffs on wood, Rottneros hopes to buy more aspen wood from Swedish producers. According to Ingemar Eliasson. There is no doubt that the competition on wood has hardened from the sulphate industries, as well as the fast growing heating sector. Bengt Algotsson, wood director of Mellanskog, says that aspen is increasingly demanded on the market, but that there also are conflicts in certain parts of Sweden between environmental interests and the industrial needs. - In order to preserve the nesting places of the White-backed Woodpecker, the felling of aspen must be limited in certain parts of Sweden.

39248.3974884259,World Pressure Sensitive Tape Demand to Rise ,"The world market for pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA, self-adhesive)

tapes is forecast to expand at an annual pace of 4.7 percent through

2010, surpassing 30 billion square meters, according to a new study

conducted by The Freedonia Group.","The study, ""World Pressure Sensitive Tapes,"" indicates tape sales will rise 5.3 percent annually to $26.5 billion as raw material costs stabilize following the 2004-2006 run-up.Opportunities exist across an array of tape-using industries, ranging from corrugated packaging and nonresidential construction to motor vehicle and electronics manufacturing. Self-adhesive tapes' cost and performance advantages will allow them to capture a greater share of joining, sealing and bonding applications from competitive technologies. Further advances will be limited by a slowdown in the construction sectors of North America and China, and by maturity of key developed world markets.Corrugated carton sealing tapes will remain the most widely used tape type, accounting for over two-thirds of aggregate sales volume. Tapes will make further inroads at the expense of competitive carton sealing media such as glues and mechanical fasteners. Rising corrugated box sales will also bode favorably for packaging tape demand, although a slowdown in processed food and beverage output will limit potential gains.The U.S. accounts for over one-fifth of global demand, although its share of the world market will continue to decline, as bedrock applications such as corrugated shipping and paint masking are now largely mature. The same can be said for other developed countries—West European nations, Japan, Canada, Australia—where annual demand growth will be in the low single digits.By contrast, there is substantial room for additional market penetration in the world's developing countries, with India, China and Eastern Europe in particular enjoying favorable prospects. China is expected to surpass the U.S. as the world's largest tape user by the end of the decade, with gains driven by explosive economic growth, rising consumer incomes, swift development of tape-intensive industries and greater availability of high quality, domestically produced tapes, especially industrial and specialty types. China is also developing a strong export position. East Asia is the leading global market for advanced electronic fabrication tapes.SOURCE: The Freedonia Group",Engelska nyheter

packaging. Billerud is now establishing its own development centre for

packaging research focused on corrugated containers that will be the

first of its kind in the world."," It will help provide consumers with better quality fruit and vegetables, among other products. Packaging is often the weak link for exports. Each year in Europe, fruit and vegetables worth around ten billion euros are destroyed because they are packaged in boxes that are damaged during transport causing the contents to be damaged, too. Growers try to avoid this problem by harvesting unripe fruit and vegetables and produce that is harder and thus more resistant to bumps and jolts during the transport phase. That means, for example, that people in Scandinavia eat less nutritious fruit and vegetables because the supply of nutrients ends as soon as the fruit is harvested. Billerud is now intensifying its research into transport packaging. The company’s new laboratory, Billerud Box Lab, will be inaugurated on June 28 at 10 am. At Box Lab, Billerud’s experts will measure the long-term performance of boxes and perform tests in a climate chamber where temperatures and moisture levels can be varied to mirror conditions in the transport phase for filled packaging.

new pigment technology enables paper industry customers to save in raw

materials consumption and improve efficiency.

 

""The share of mineral pigments in paper production is due to increase

worldwide demand will increase at an annual rate of about three percent

for the next ten years and that the consumption of calcium sulfate

pigments will increase in both filler and paper coating applications,""

39307.6463773148,Bleaching change in Botnias Rauma mill,"A new ECF bleaching (Elemental Chlorine Free) process has started up at

Botnia's Rauma mill. As a result, the proportion of reinforcement pulp

will increase, product brightness will improve and more pulp will be

obtained from the same amount of feedstock. In its environmental

impact, the new process is the equal of the original TCF (Total

Chlorine Free) process.","Rauma mill has switched from totally chlorine free bleaching process to bleaching with chlorine dioxide i.e. ECF bleaching since ECF bleached pulp is more suitable for Botnia's customers' processes. Another reason why the situation has changed radically is that development of pulping technology and the ECF process have made it the equal of TCF bleaching in terms of its effects on the environment.The new bleaching process will raise Rauma's production capacity by about 45 000 tonnes. The product palette in turn will become simpler when three grades are replaced by two – reinforcement pulp and standard softwood pulp.Thanks to the change in bleaching method, pulp brightness can be increased. In TCF bleaching, brightness had to be sacrificed in order to achieve the other characteristics expected from a reinforcement pulp.The new process reduces the environmental load in several ways. More pulp will be obtained from the same amount of wood. The product can be piped to the neighbouring paper mill, which will same energy in drying and transport.

Swedish government-owned Sveaskog was recently responsible for the

introduction of new prices in Norrbotten. The price of softwood pulp

was raised from 300 kronor to 330 kronor per cubic meter, representing

a 27-percent increase compared with the autumn of 2006.","During his 19 years as President of SCA Skog, Jerker Karlsson has not experienced anything similar, according to the Swedish financial daily DI.“Timber prices have reached a historically high level – higher that the record year of 1995. Naturally, these prices will have an impact on our earnings,” says Jerker Karlsson to DI.The price of timber and pulpwood in Northern Sweden has risen 20 percent since March. In April, SCA Skog increased the price for saw timber by 70-100 kronor per cubic meter, measured solid under bark. A full 362 kronor per cubic meter is being paid for spruce pulpwood in the area surrounding the Ortviken mill. The key question is how much the pulp industry can withstand. “It’s difficult to say, I think that SCA’s industries have good possibilities to keep up with the competition for this raw material,” says Karlsson. Håkan Alexandersson, regional operations manager for Sörmland at Mellanskog, sees no signs of a break in the trend of increasing prices of pulpwood.

In a battle against the clock and largely due to the efforts of its members, one of the key risk factors for a widespread bark beetle rejuvenation in Södra’s region has been eliminated.","“Per’s broad impact across Södra’s region has made storm processing extremely time-consuming and complex. Södra’s members and personnel have done a fantastic job in the race against these harmful insects,” says Södra’s CEO Leif Brodén. The total volume of storm wood processed by Södra amounts to 7.6 million m3fub – more than the original estimate of 5.2 million m3fub. A number of reasons lie behind the significant increase in volume, including the increase caused by several minor storms and the difficulty in estimating such widespread volumes. Significant volumes of wood were still being noted right up until the final phase of the work. The approach has been to receive storm wood that is notified even after the final notification date has passed – despite the capacity shortage and the tight timeframe. “Since 1 July alone we’ve received late notifications totalling 600,000 m3fub. New volumes have even been coming in during the last few days,” says Södra’s Forestry Director Mats Sandgren. By 1 August the last wood had been taken from the forest to roads by forwarder. This means that Södra managed to process the storm wood within the framework for the dispensation provided by the authorities.

The 800 million Kronor investment will allow paper production at Ortviken

to continue to increase, while providing significant quality

improvements. The investment will be completed by spring 2009.","“Through our just established joint venture with Statkraft, we have now secured long term supply of electricity at a very competitive price and allows for this investment. Since our most recent paper machine went into operation in 1995 we have increased production by almost 50% through fine tuning and investments to eliminate bottlenecks,” says Kenneth Eriksson, President of SCA Forest Products. “We have now reached a level where pulp production is restricting the mill’s continued development.”The major items in the investment are new refiners with high capacity. It is in the refineries that the raw material, fresh spruce pulpwood, is ground to pulp. But the investment also involves separating pulp production and customizing it for the different paper grades.“Our present pulp mill produces pulp for all our four paper machines,” says Kenneth Eriksson. “This means we must prepare the pulp in different ways depending on whether we are producing newsprint or coated publication papers. As a result of this investment, we will be able to prepare the pulp from the outset for the product for which it will be used. This will lead to improved product quality but also means that we will save money and other resources by doing it right from the start instead of preparing the finished pulp for each application.”Work on implementing this investment will start immediately.

international competitiveness, as a result of increased production

costs and high energy taxes. This is the opinion of Anne Brunila,

President of the Finnish Forest Industries Federation.","At a meeting in Mikkeli at the end of last week, Anne Brunila spoke in relatively pessimistic terms about the current state of the Finnish forest industry and the future.Among other comments, she said there is a risk that extensive work carried out in recent years to improve the industry’s profitability could be in vain. A great number of skillfully implemented efficiency enhancements among the leading companies in the forest industry are beginning to be rapidly eaten up by sharply rising production costs.“In just a short time costs for raw materials, energy, transport and labor have climbed significantly in Finland and up to 50 percent more than comparable price hikes in our most important competing countries,” she said. “Competition in the industry is intense and the cost increases noted cannot be transferred to product prices.”According to Brunila, trading in emissions rights and high energy taxes in Finland are also an extra burden on the industry.Each year, the Finnish forest industry pays about 60 million Euros in a type of industrial energy tax that does not exist in, for example, Sweden. It is estimated that a recently announced hike in the Finnish energy taxes next year will add another ten million Euros and more in charges to be absorbed by the forest industry in Finland. /AA",Engelska nyheter

at the two Norwegian units, Norske Skog Parenco in Holland and Norske

Skog Golbey in France will reduce their production of newsprint by 24

000 tonnes each.

 

The curtailment will result in improved profitability for Norske Skog.

39353.6137847222,Topping-out ceremony at UPM’s recovery plant project,"Sept 28, 2007 The topping-out ceremony for the chemical recovery plant project at UPM’s Kymi pulp mill in Kuusankoski was held on September 27. About 700 guests and project personnel attended the ceremony.","The investment will enable the Kymi integrated fine paper and pulp mill

to increase its energy self-sufficiency, cut production costs and

reduce the environmental load such as carbon dioxide emissions. The

plant also allows for the increased use of biofuels and the doubling of

bioelectricity production capacity. In addition, the investment

supports an increase in pulp production in the future. The new recovery

plant will be on stream in summer 2008.

The recovery plant project, REC08, aims to replace the two outdated and

cost-inefficient recovery lines from 1964 and 1976 with a modern plant.

Currently, the project personnel stands at 692, and the focus so far

has been on completing the construction work. Construction crews will

soon give way to the equipment installation crews, who will be busiest

at the end of the year. At its peak at year-end the project will employ

about 900 persons. The number of foreign workers at the multinational

project is currently about 100, and they come from Russia, Poland,

Estonia, Slovakia, Hungary and Germany.

A total of 116 companies have so far worked on the project. Of them, 50

have been construction companies. Over 100 equipment and installation

agreements have also been signed, and building projects total nearly 50.

Almost 60 percent of all building contracts and commissions have been

carried out by companies from northern Kymenlaakso. The share of local

subcontractors in equipment delivery and installation has been clearly

smaller.

The project schedule has been demanding and labour intensive. For

example, almost 140,000 tonnes of bedrock has been excavated and

crushed for use as the plant foundation. At the same time, 18,000 m³ of

concrete has been cast and 5,200 precast concrete elements installed.

The project also includes the installation of almost 6,000 tonnes of

steel structures./KB

paper recycling rate of 63.4 percent. 58.2 million tons of paper and board were recycled in Europe last year.","The Monitoring Report 2006 gives an overview of achievements in 2006, including the latest figures of the European paper recycling rate. A total of 58.2 million tons of paper and board were recycled in Europe in 2006; an increase of 5.7 million tons (or +9.8 percent) since 2004, the base year for the target.Recycling  of paper is a significant part of the paper manufacturing process in Europe but also a large industry in its own right, with links to a number of sectors in the global economy. It was only last year that 13 different sectors in the paper value chain pledged their support  for the new European Declaration on Paper Recycling covering all paper and board products  and aiming to make sure that all of the correct systems are in place to push the European  paper recycling rate to 66 percent by 2010. The Declaration focuses on complementary actions by all of the sectors involved, and gives priority to the prevention of waste, improving the recyclability of paper and board products by  eco-design, as well as further improving the quality of recovered paper available for recycling.  Reaching the target of 66 percent would mean that some two tons of paper are recycled in Europe every second. Europe is already the global champion in paper recycling with a regional rate of 63.4 percent, higher than either Asia or America. The industries along the paper value chain have nevertheless raised the bar. “Our members have made focused efforts over the past year to boost the recovery and recycling rates of paper and board in Europe, and I believe the result speaks for itself.

39371.4422453704,UPM launch new smart packaging solution,"Oct 16, 2007 UPM has developed a new smart packaging solution that aids consumers and the food industry to monitor and self-assess their produce's shelf life. The company will introduce the packaging solution at the PacTec 2007 fair held at the Helsinki Fair Centre in October.","The new packaging solution introduces further development in the

functionality of food packaging. In addition to performing its primary

function, the package also gives consumers directions on use and

product information. A unique label turns from transparent to blue,

informing the consumer that air has replaced the modified atmosphere

gases within the package.

“The colour change of the packaging label allows the consumer to make a

personal assessment of the product based on his/her own sensory

findings, and consume the product well before the best before date. An

uninterrupted cold chain and the correct storage of products are the

basis of food safety. The new packaging solution is an easy quality

control tool for shops and producers alike”, says Timo Äijälä, UPM,

Venture Manager, Smart Labels.

Officials also welcome the idea of functional intelligent packaging

solutions. “Finland is at the forefront of developing and producing

food products with health benefits. Similar development that aids the

food industry can be seen in these innovations regarding food

packaging”, says Jaana Husu-Kallio from Evira, the Finnish Food Safety

The European market balance for newsprint is also affected by increased imports from Canada. This has led to lower deliveries and substantial newsprint stocks being established in Europe.

Norske Skog has already decided to implement a temporary reduction of 200,000 tons in European newsprint production in 2008.

39399.4219212963,CEPI develops Carbon Footprint Framework for Paper and Board  ,"Nov 13 2007 The Confederation of European Paper Industries (CEPI) has

developed a Carbon Footprint Framework for paper and board products.

The framework is a response to the requests by paper buyers for a

statement on the carbon footprint of paper products."," The carbon footprint of a product may be seen as a balance sheet of greenhouse gas emissions and removals (transfers to and from the atmosphere) and because these balance sheets usually cover more than carbon dioxide, the units of reporting are usually carbon dioxide equivalents. The framework looks at direct and indirect emissions, carbon sequestration in forests and in products, the value of bio-energy and the concept of avoided emissions and proposes a common approach to deal with them.   “Climate change has become a topic of high public interest and society is continually looking at how carbon dioxide emissions can be reduced. Recently we have seen a shift of focus from production to emissions associated with products and we are being asked more and more for clear information on the carbon footprint of our products,“ commented Teresa Presas, managing director of CEPI.   “Underlining a commitment to transparency this common framework allowsour members to present to buyers a standardized, clear and credible statement for all of their products and also puts the paper and board sector at the forefront of the debate showing that we are committed to mitigating climate change. We are not waiting to act but have taken our responsibility seriously and have been proactive in providing solutions to improve decision making processes,“ said Presas./KB",Engelska nyheter

and in many other countries. That is the message from Jussi Pesonen,

Chairman of the Finnish Forest Industries

Federation and CEO of UPM, at the Federation’s Annual

Autumn Meeting in Helsinki on November 16.","“We must rise above present challenges and look to the future. The industry must not come to a halt – we must ensure that a successful forest cluster is active in Finland even decades from now, providing jobs and prosperity through the sustainable and diverse exploitation of a renewable raw material. Increasing the efficiency of operations, streamlining structures and developing new businesses and products will safeguard the industry’s competitiveness and establish a strong foundation for future,” said Jussi Pesonen.“In the future, the forest industry will be a very different sector from what it is today. The structure of manufacturing and product ranges will evolve. I foresee a lowering of the barriers that separate manufacturing from services as well as the adoption of networked activities between strategic partners. The decisions being made right now will establish a foundation on which the regeneration and competitiveness of our industry will lean on,” Pesonen pointed out.Superior productivity development and a high degree of value-added input combined with products that suit the needs of customers are necessary tools for victory in international competition, according to Jussi Pesonen. He mentioned the overall cost level as a current challenge for the forest industry. The cost of raw materials, labour and transports is higher in Finland than in key rival countries.“A lot of work is needed to improve Finland’s cost competitiveness. In addition to measures undertaken by companies themselves, state authorities play a crucial role in the development of our operating environment. New openings to ensure the availability of domestic timber are required. Climate and energy policy decisions have a decisive impact on the forest industry’s opportunities to manufacture sophisticated paper and wood products, generate bioenergy and produce second-generation biofuels,” added Pesonen. /KB",Engelska nyheter
39405.3864467593,Södra Cell’s president condemns ‘FSC or bust’ attitude,"Nov 19 2007  Sten Holmberg, the president of Europe’s largest market pulp producer, Södra Cell, has warned of the dangers of a monopoly forest certification market, where FSC is seen as the only truly environmental choice when it comes to certified pulp and paper.","Speaking at the BWPA/Hawkins Wright Symposium 2007 during Pulp Week in London last week, Sten Holmberg underlined that “something is happening in the UK in the name of forest certification, which we think has little to do with sustainability but everything to do with perception and nothing to do with freedom of choice.""""Largely due to pressure by some organizations, it’s ‘FSC or bust’ as far as many retailers and publishers are concerned. We think there is a real and present danger that more retailers will feel the pressure to demand only FSC-certified pulp and paper,” Holmberg said.Holmberg went on to point out that Södra has no axe to grind with the FSC. On the contrary, Södra Cell produces some FSC-certified pulp, as well as PEFC. But, he said, the growing recognition of the FSC logo on products has less to do with its environmental superiority over PEFC and more to do with the fact that FSC has been much better marketed than PEFC. The amount of FSC pulp on the market remains limited with only around five percent of global softwood market pulp currently FSC certified. In the face of tight FSC-certified paper supply, end users are putting pressure on their paper suppliers, and in turn pulp suppliers, to switch to FSC.“We strongly believe there has to be a market for more than just one forest certification scheme,"" Sten Holmberg said. ""It can be in no-one’s interests to see buyers demanding FSC just out of fear of a negative reaction from some NGOs. Södra has a long history of sustainable forest management which is one of our key values. We are proud to be PEFC and do not intend to turn our backs on a scheme we have helped to develop,” Holmberg concluded. /AA",Engelska nyheter

of restructuring its manufacturing resources at its two Swedish units

in Grästorp and Kamfab AB in Karlstad. The company will commence

personnel negotiations at both locations immediately and the aim is to

finish them by the end of January 2008.","The measures support the implementation of Metso's global operations footprint strategy and target to improve Metso Paper's competitiveness by strengthening its operations closer to customers in the emerging markets. At the same time the company is developing the profitability and productivity of its units located in the Nordic countries. he Kamfab factory in Karlstad belongs to Metso Paper’s Fiber business line and currently manufactures machinery and equipment for pulp making. It became a part of Metso in the beginning of 2007 as a result of the acquisition of the Aker Kvaerner's Pulping business, and its capacity has been underutilized due to the overlaps with Metso's other operations in the Nordic countries. The plan now is to transfer the unit into a service unit for the European pulp industry customers. The negotiations will affect approximately 90 persons. The Grästorp unit, which is a part of the Paper and Board business line and employs approximately 50 persons, manufactures screen baskets. Metso's plan is to concentrate the screen basket production to other units outside Sweden. The negotiations will cover all operations and personnel groups.

Change negotiations,” said World Bank President Zoellick. “The Forest

Carbon Partnership Facility signals that the world cares about the

global value of forests and is ready to pay for it. This can change the

evaluating “The Top Suppliers of Office Paper” in Europe. The supplier

index ranking list is topped by resellers Viking Direct (Office Depot),

followed by Lyreco (Lyreco) and Quill (Staples).","The study ranks suppliers of office paper based on how well they fulfil the demands on a number of supplier- and service-related criteria as well as the loyalty towards the suppliers. The results are based on more than 4000 interviews with professional end users of office paper across seven countries in Europe.   Opticom’s Supplier Index shows that office paper buyers are generally most satisfied with resellers of office supplies, followed by paper merchants, OEMs and general retailers. Considering relative performance on a number of supplier- and service-related criteria, the same pattern can be observed. “Resellers as a group have clearly improved their performance in comparison to the merchant groups. It seems as though the leading office supplies resellers have a better understanding of the high demands of their customers, but loyalty is still dependent on other factors as well as can be seen by  the large differences between the different suppliers.” says Marijn van der Sluijs, Project Manager at Opticom. When it comes to loyalty, office paper buyers also appear to be most loyal towards office supplies resellers, but the difference between paper merchants, OEMs and general retailers is much smaller.

The intention is to stop production at the mill in the second quarter of 2008. A total of 140 employees are affected.,"The decision to discontinue operations at Utansjö was taken back in August 2006, when negotiations with union representatives according to the Swedish Co-Determination Act were initiated. The reason for this move was the dramatically increased electricity prices. Although electricity prices have since fallen for short periods, the prices from 2008 are still at an unacceptable level for the long term, Rottneros states in a press release. Pulpwood prices have also risen dramatically. The Rottneros board and management have concluded that, under these circumstances, it is impossible to keep the mill running until the end of 2008, which was the original intention. The size of the financial provisions needed for the closure will be announced in connection with the publication of the year-end release on 1 February. Provisions for the closure will negatively impact the first quarter 2008 profits while the write-down resulting from a valuation of the plant-s fair value will affect 2007. The closure of the Utansjö mill will positively affect the group-s cash-flow. The intention is to move the production line for pulp of the CTMP type, which went into operation in 2005, to a country with lower energy prices and good access to raw materials at acceptable prices. This resulted in a letter of intent signed by Rottneros and the South African forest company NCT in March 2007 on the possibility of building a jointly-owned mill for the production of mechanical pulp of the CTMP type in South Africa.If the plans are carried out, the CTMP line at Utansjö will be sold to a jointly owned company in South Africa and a new mill could be operational in 2009.

The reasons for the capacity and resource cuts announced on 25 October 2007 have unfortunately not changed - excess capacity in standard and improved newsprint and uncoated magazine paper, and dramatic cost increases, especially for imported wood.","As a result of the negotiations, the total number of personnel will be

retraining and employment support is intended to assist the remaining

approximately 560 people affected.

 

Kemijärvi Pulp Mill will be permanently closed down to safeguard the

supply of domestic pulpwood to the mills at Veitsiluoto and Oulu and

reduce imports of excessively expensive wood. Closure of Kemijärvi Pulp

Mill will reduce long-fibre pulp production by 250 000 tonnes, pulpwood

consumption by 1.4 million cubic meters and electricity consumption by

140 GWh per year. Kemijärvi Mill will be permanently closed down by the

end April 2008 with 214 job losses.

 

Summa Mill in Kymenlaakso is being closed down because of persistent

losses in recent years and poor long-term profitability prospects.

Despite tremendous efforts by its employees, the mill cannot compete in

today's and tomorrow's markets using expensive virgin wood fibre, much

of which is imported. Closure of Summa Mill will reduce Stora Enso's

annual capacity by 270 000 tonnes of standard and improved newsprint

and 80 000 tonnes of uncoated magazine paper. Pulpwood consumption will

be reduced by 1 million cubic meters, releasing the pulpwood from

domestic sources for use at other Stora Enso mills. Electricity

consumption will be reduced by 1 000 GWh per year. Summa Mill will be

permanently closed down at the end of January 2008 with 450 job losses.

""Our announced plans to close down the mills at Summa and Kemijärvi

have received a lot of attention. Nevertheless, following the

co-determination negotiations, we remain convinced that we must

continue on essentially the course defined in our plans announced on 25

October, as our views on the amount of domestic wood available to Stora

Enso and the markets for these papers have not changed. We must

safeguard the future of the whole Group and Stora Enso Finland,"" said

Stora Enso CEO Jouko Karvinen.

 

""In close co-operation with national and local organizations, we are

starting to identify economically viable solutions to minimize the

impact of our decisions. Since the measures we must take will have very

serious consequences for so many people, I now implore all stakeholders

to join us in rapidly establishing new businesses at the sites affected

and motivating employees who can move to seek alternative employment

elsewhere with Company support. It is time to find solutions that

safeguard the futures of Stora Enso in Finland and the employees at the

affected sites. We have had several expressions of interest that

support our stated strategy, and I would be happy to see more. We need

to find those solutions as fast as we ever can, so we have hired Ernst

""In early November we announced a 5 million Euros voluntary support

package to help the personnel affected to find new employment. We are

today doubling that amount. The additional 5 million Euros will be

focused entirely on offering financial support for employees

participating in retraining so they can obtain employment in new

businesses created at the affected locations.

 

We want to find uses for the properties at Summa and Kemijärvi that

will establish economically viable businesses, which will create new

employment without competing with Stora Enso for critical pulpwood

supplies or product markets. Some of the initiatives under discussion

are based on the use of Eastern Lapland forest resources and support

Stora Enso's pulpwood procurement policy as well,"" concluded Jouko

39470.5975,New method for modifying products containing wood fibers developed in Finland,Jan 23 2008  VTT Technical Research Center of Finland has developed a method that opens up new opportunities for the use of lignin-containing wood fibers and other natural fibers as well as fiber products.,"The new method offers an environmentally friendly approach to customize or even to introduce completely new properties, such as moisture repellency or electric conductivity, to fiber-containing products. The chemo-enzymatic modification method of fiber materials enables manufacturers to better tailor the fiber properties according to the desired end product. The method can be used to enhance the original properties or even to introduce new properties to lignin-containing fiber materials. To achieve the desired modification, suitable chemical compounds are attached to the material in a chemical or enzymatic process. Wood fiber products are moisture absorbent by nature. The new method makes it possible to control the moisture resistance properties of lignin-containing fiber materials even to a degree where they become water-resistant. This opens up new opportunities for the use of wood fibers for example in the packaging industry.Manufacturers in industries such as the biocomposites, building and speciality paper and packaging industries, utilising materials containing lignocellulosic fibers in composite structures, can benefit from VTT's method for developing various product properties. For example, the process can be used to make antistatic filter papers.""Chemo-enzymatic fiber modification creates new opportunities for the processing of existing fiber products and for manufacturing fiber products in the paper and packaging process. In the future, tailored wood fibers may present a viable alternative for example to synthetic fibers in various industrial composites,"" says Anna Suurnäkki, Senior Research Scientist at VTT. /AA",Engelska nyheter

The objective is to be ready by the end of the year to decide on building a commercial scale plant.             In the production concept developed by UPM and L&T, ethanol and energy are produced from commercial and industrial waste, such as paper, cardboard, wood and plastic. The paper industry's de-inking sludge, which is generated in mills that use recycled fibre when printing ink is removed from recovered paper, is also a suitable raw material. When mixed with petrol, ethanol manufactured from these raw materials that, until now, have been utilized only partly is suitable for traffic biofuel.                                                            The planned ethanol and energy production plant can operate in connection with a waste treatment unit or a paper mill. A part of the waste used as raw material is utilized for generating ethanol and a part for generating energy. The solution makes it possible to manufacture cost-effective second-generation biofuels for traffic in Europe without endangering the raw material supply of the forest industry.                                                            In EU's recent energy and climate package, it is considered that biofuels produced from waste and ligno-cellulosic material contribute to the mitigation of climate change more than other biofuels. Their contribution in the targeted consumption volume set by the EU is considered to be twice that of traditional biofuels.                                                                       Utilizing commercial and industrial waste in the production of ethanol and energy causes remarkably less greenhouse gas emissions than dumping the waste at a landfill. Making ethanol from waste puts less stress on the climate than its production from grain, which is the traditional raw material. In addition, using waste promotes the recycling of material in accordance with the principles of sustainable development. /KB",Engelska nyheter

39482.4947453704,Myllykoski's new paper manufacturing line at Plattling Papier up and running,Feb 4 2008  The new PM1 paper manufacturing line was successfully started up at Myllykoski’s Plattling Papier in Germany in the beginning of December. The line is one of the largest in the world and represents the latest SC paper technology.,"“We broke ground for our new uncoated publication paper mill only 13 months ago. Now we are proud and happy,” says Caius Murtola, Project Director of Plattling Papier. ""Even though we are still in the optimizing phase, we can clearly see that the new line will become one of the best SC-A paper machines in the world. The printing results have so far been extremely good compared with other SC-papers.""With a width of over eleven meters, the Metso supplied machine makes use of state-of-the-art technologies for SC paper. Unlike many other current SC producers, Plattling Papier decided to use pressure grinders rather than refiners for pulping wood. This produces a groundwood  pulp that has a particularly high content of fines and offers a wood yield of nearly 100 percent coupled with low specific energy consumption.Running the pulp through the high turbulence headbox and the symmetrical dewatering of the fiber slurry over the twin-wire ensure an even formation on both sides, giving an optimized print quality on both sides of the paper, according to a mill spokesman. The proven technologies used in the press section make sure that the paper web is dewatered evenly on both sides and that a homogeneous surface is created at the thickening stage. The high mechanical pressure is provided by four nips.The new line at Plattling Papier is equipped with the first online SC-A calendaring in the world combined with “moisture gradient” technology and the use of pressurized groundwood. When the paper web enters the calender after the drying section, the web is re-moisturized so that  the core of the paper remains dry and the fibers on the surface become elastic.The PM1 is of Metso Paper's OptiConcept design and has a wire width of 11.3 meters and a design speed of 2,000 meters per minute. A special feature of the PM1 is the OptiLoad TwinLine on-line multi-nip calender. The whole production is handled with two WinRoll winders with an automatic StreamLine roll wrapping and handling system. The winders and roll wrapping system are capable of handling large customer rolls up to a width of 5.2 meters. Metso Automation has provided a comprehensive automation and quality management solution. /AA",Engelska nyheter

In Helsinki, the protest movement from Kemijärvi demonstrated in front of the parliament building, and tomorrow, Wednesday, a protest strike is being threatened at all Stora Enso plants in Finland.","Following the demonstration outside the parliament building in Helsinki, a petition was presented to Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen, Defense Minister Jyri Häkämies (who is responsible for the country’s corporate governance) and Finance Minister Jyrki Katainen. The petition was signed by nearly 28,000 persons.Representatives of the protest movement also met with Stora Enso’s management and Finland’s president, Tarja Halonen, on Monday.The one-day strike planned for Wednesday affects all union employees at Stora Enso’s plants in Finland. During the strike, personnel will be at their workplaces, but will discontinue production. The work stoppage will begin at 6:00 a m and continue for 24 hours. The employer perception of the production stop is that it is illegal and the intent is to file charges against the union.At the same time, the agreement is being questioned between Stora Enso and the Anaika Group, who will take over the plant in Kemijärvi to produce glulam beams. Stora Enso’s motivation for closing the plant in Kemijärvi is the shortage of pulpwood, which is planned to be used by Anaika Group for the production of glulam beams. According to Tapio Ylikangas, Stora Enso’s site manager at Kemijärvi, the glulam plant will only use ten percent of the supply of pulpwood and that the rest of the pulpwood can, accordingly, be used by other plants.The Finnish government has promised support to the Anaika Group's planned operations in Kemijärvi in the amount of ten million Euros. According to some informaton, there is a prevailing overcapacity of glulam beams, and Minister of Industry Mauri Pekkatinen admits that the situation for the industry in general is not bright. He emphasizes that the government cannot guarantee that the planned production of glulam beams in Kemijärvi will be profitable. /AA",Engelska nyheter

The company will also make fundamental changes to its management structure and remove head office functions.,"An increasingly weak market has resulted in temporary production shut-downs at several Norske Skog mills in recent years. The production capacity is therefore not utilised in an efficient manner. At the same time, the continued excess capacity has resulted in a weak price development for the company's products. In total, 450,000 tons of production capacity is proposed to be shut down. This amounts to about seven percent of the company's total production capacity globally.""Over the last couple of years, cost increases and excess capacity have reduced Norske Skog's profitability to a level which not is financially sustainable.

39493.3817708333,VTT and UPM to establish Center for Nanocellulosic Technologies,"Feb 15 2008  VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, Helsinki

University of Technology and UPM have established a Center for Nanocellulosic Technologies. It aims to create new

applications for cellulose as a raw material, substance and end

product.

 ","The Center for Nanocellulosic Technologies will start operating on 1 March 2008. Its operations will be centralized in Otaniemi, Espoo, and will employ around 40 researchers. It is an equal consortium of three partners. The operations are being financed by public and private investments.Cellulose-based nanofibers can be used to alter the structure of the

material and create products that better correspond to future market

needs. Cellulose fibers (30 micrometers wide, 2-3 millimeters long) consist of nanofibrils that are about one-thousandth of the dimensions of a cellulose fiber. One of the challenges in research is to produce large quantities of nanofibrils of even quality.Nanofibrils provide a number of possibilities for treating wood fiber materials and adding completely new properties to them. The mechanical properties of raw materials can be improved, their moisture behaviour controlled, electrical properties changed or optical properties adjusted. Applications include special papers, paper coating, packages and building materials. In addition to the paper and packaging industry, the construction, vehicle, furniture, electronics, food product and cosmetics industries can create added value for their products using tailored fiber materials. /KB",Engelska nyheter

The operating profit increased by 118 million Kronor to 1,669 million (1,551 million).","2007 was a strong year characterised by a strong market for solid wood products and yet another major storm. Record sales were noted in all business areas due to higher volumes and/or higher prices. Price increases for pulp and sawn timber compensated for the effects of a weaker dollar. Return on capital employed was 15 per cent, up from 14 per cent in 2006. Södra’s average return over the last five-years has been twelve per cent.The year was characterised by continuing strong markets for long- and short-fiber pulp. Profit in the pulp business declined somewhat nonetheless, primarily as a result of increased wood and chemical costs. Capacity utilisation in the pulp industry was, as usual, high during the year, with low inventory levels at both producers and buyers. Södra’s inventory was less than a month’s supply at the end of the year. Södra increased market share in its main European market, due to the absence of new long-fiber capacity in the market, and Canadian suppliers prioritising non-European markets. The price of bleached softwood sulphate pulp rose from 730 to 870 Dollars per ton during the year. “We are maintaining our profitability, despite another storm in 2007, Storm Per.

The technology has since January 2007 been verified in a demonstration plant at Bäckhammar mill.The LignoBoost process gives a solid wood originating lignin product, which can be used as fossil fuel replacement, for example in lime kilns, and also shows promise as feed-stock for value added products, such as phenol, benzene and composite materials. Implemented in a kraft pulp mill it can become totally fossil fuel free and also supply other pulp mills with lignin. As an example the 16 Swedish kraft pulp mills can become totally fossil fuel free if the LignoBoost technology was implemented in five or six Swedish kraft pulp mills. The LignoBoost process also allows a pulp mill to cost efficiently expand the capacity, according to a STFI-Packforsk spokesperson.A typical LignoBoost installation would produce about 50,000 tons of lignin per year, which can replace 32,000 tons of fuel oil. This is significantly more than is needed to make the mill totally fossil fuel free and allows others to use the lignin as well. At the same time this gives the pulp mill a potential to produce roughly 70,000 additional tons of pulp.Currently LignoBoost AB has initiated and carried out over ten commercial pre-studies for pulp and paper companies. In three of these cases in-depth feasibility studies have been carried out. Two companies have performed complete pre-projects. /AA",Engelska nyheter

The Swedish Government Agency for Innovation Systems, Vinnova, has agreed to fund the project as part of the Sectoral R&D programme for Sweden’s forest-based industry. The overriding objective of Formulosa is to develop materials technology for paperboard packaging. The focus is on three areas: new packaging made of rigid lightweight paperboard, freely-mouldable cellulose, and composite materials consisting of cellulose fibres and thermoplastics. This will be achieved by developing intelligent solutions that chemically modify the cellulose. The project will provide opportunities for the cost optimisation of packaging by using more rigid paperboard, as well as strong, mouldable and rigid composites, and wood/cellulose that is freely mouldable. The research will be carried out in close collaboration between the companies and the research groups for Organic Chemistry and for Polymeric materials at the Chalmers University of Technology. Food packaging is generally important because of its preserving qualities. It protects food, not just against damage in transit but also against attack by micro-organisms. Strategies for sustainable development include reducing the weight of the packaging and also increasing the proportion of renewable raw materials and both these areas will be researched. Packaging weight can be reduced, as making the carton more rigid reduces the consumption of fibres. Any increase in the use of forest-based raw materials will contribute to a more sustainable community. Formulosa will strengthen the existing Södra and Chalmers research cluster known as Avancell – Centre for Fibre Engineering. Research is already being done there into the organic chemistry modification of cellulose fibres. The project will apply “Green Chemistry”, a concept for sustainable chemistry published by the American Chemical Society.

stopping the project will be about 450 million Norwegian Kroner (82 million Dollars).

As the costs of the construction of paper machine 2 in Brazil have turned out to be so high, we were forced to stop the project for financial reasons,"" says chief executive Christian Rynning-Tønnesen.In 2006, Norske Skog decided to move one of the paper machines at the discontinued mill Norske Skog Union in Skien to Norske Skog Pisa in Brazil. The project had an original cost limit of 210 million Dollars.Following reports of possible cost overruns in the project earlier this year, a group of Norske Skog employees and external specialists were tasked with auditing the project. The group's report was ready on Friday 29 February, and it showed that the total costs of completing the project would be significantly higher than budgeted.The possible cost overruns were presented to the board on 4 March. It was then decided that he project would be temporarily halted to await the corporate management's assessment of the costs of stopping the project versus completing it. The corporate management's assessment was presented to the board on 10 March, and the board then decided to stop the project.The accounting cost before tax will be about 125 million Dollars in the first quarter. Tax effects of 17 million and termination of currency hedging with a cash effect of 26 million are deducted. The net effect for the group after tax and currency hedging will therefore be about 82 million Dollars.Parts of the project, which will benefit the remaining part of Norske Skog Pisa, will be completed. The paper machine itself will be stored at the mill. The project may therefore be restarted at a later time if it appears financially prudent. The board of Norske Skog has been kept continuously informed of the project's progress. The progress of the project and capitalized project costs adhered to the adopted project plan until January 2008. There was no reporting about the risk of significant cost overruns before the board meeting on 4 March.In order to illuminate the issue properly, and to avoid similar cases in the future, the board has decided to carry out an external investigation of the project and the decision process.

foreign interests. Purchases of land involving more than 250 hectares

","“There is land purchase legislation in many countries, but if this is passed, it will entail additional bureaucracy in purchasing land her,” says Nils Grafström, head of Stora Enso’s Latin America Division to the DI business daily. Currently, there are already limits on the purchase of land by foreign interests, but the rule has been subverted through purchases via local companies, which the Brazilian government now wants to change. The new proposal is that purchases of land involving more than 250 hectares by foreigners shall be reviewed by the country’s congress, writes DI.Stora Enso, which is a large landowner in the country, has already purchased 46,000 hectares of land. “It is adequate for planting for awhile, but a plant for a million tons of pulp per year needs at least 100,000 hectares of planted forest.

39532.5797800926,BASF collaborating with STFI-Packforsk for biobased raw materials,March 25 2008  The world leading chemical company BASF has begun working jointly with Swedish research company STFI-Packforsk to find biobased raw materials for BASF's production of chemical products in the future.,"“It’s extremely exciting that BASF has decided to start this cooperation,” comments Peter Axegård, Research Director of the STFI-Packforsk Fibre, Pulp, Energy & Chemical Division. “STFI-Packforsk is at the forefront when it comes to new techniques and technology for wood based energy and biobased chemicals. The new technology developed by STFI-Packforsk and Chalmers – the LignoBoost Process – that separates lignin from pulp in pulp mills to produce energy or chemicals, is on its way into the pulp industry. Furthermore, STFI-Packforsk possesses very sound knowledge of the processes and infrastructure in the pulp and paper industry.” Mario Knoke, BASF scientist, says that BASF is continuously carrying out research into new ways of using renewable resources and their derivatives. “We expect that STFI-Packforsk will be able to support us in identifying new raw materials for us. In addition, we want to look for possible collaborations with the pulp and paper industry to test biobased raw materials to be used by BASF in practice. Today, we buy petroleum products as raw materials and produce a variety of chemicals from these. And we are using renewable resources and their derivatives wherever technologically feasible and both ecologically and economically attractive.” Lignin is the first thing to be studied in the collaborative work between BASF and STFI-Packforsk. Among other products, there is a lot of interest in producing phenols and benzene from lignin. To begin with, the collaboration between BASF and STFI-Packforsk comprises a six months pre-project, commencing in March this year. Mario Knoke expects that there will be a continuation, but an evaluation of the pre-project must take place first. “If we see that the results point to industrial possibilities in the future, we’ll continue,” he concludes. /AA",Engelska nyheter

39545.4203703704,Finland and Sweden are increasing imports of pulpwood,April 7 2008  Pulpmills in Finland and Sweden are increasing imports of pulpwood as domestic wood fiber costs are reaching 15-year highs.,"High wood costs and the prospect of reduced log supply from Russia in the coming years forces many pulpmills in the Nordic countries to re-evaluate their wood fiber procurement strategies. Increasing wood chip imports from Latin America and North America together with higher domestic timber harvests can be expected in 2008, according to the Wood Resource Quarterly (WRQ).   The Finnish forest industry is facing difficulties with high wood costs and the prospect of sharply reduced log supply from Russia in the coming years. The industry has already started to alter their log procurement strategy by increased imports from other countries and intensified campaigns to encourage private forest owners to increase logging activities in Finland.According to the Wood Resource Quarterly, the average conifer sawlog prices reached an all-time record in the fourth quarter of 2007, almost 60 percent higher than just two years ago. Pulpwood costs were also substantially higher than the previous year. As a result of the high cost and reduced imports from Russia, pulp companies in the Nordic countries are increasingly exploring opportunities to source their mills with wood fiber from Latin America and North America.  Over the past six years, imports of softwood chips to Finland have increased over 50 percent, reaching about 1.4 million tons in 2007. Total chip imports to the countries in Northern Europe in 2007 were just over four million tons. In addition to imports of wood chips, forest companies also imported about 22 million cubic meters of roundwood last year, of which an estimated 80 percent were consumed by the pulp sector.Over the next few years, the Finnish forest industry is likely to go through a number of changes, including a decline in the consumption of wood raw-material, higher reliance on domestic timber, reduced imports of Russian logs and increased imports of roundwood and chips from Sweden, the Baltic States and Latin America, according to WRQ. /AA",Engelska nyheter

39556.5022916667,Finnish researchers receive the Marcus Wallenberg Prize,"April 18 2008  The 2008 Marcus Wallenberg Prize is awarded to Bjarne Holmbom and Christer Eckerman, Åbo Akademi University, Turku, Finland.","The Marcus Wallenberg Prize is awarded to Bjarne Holmbom and Christer Eckerman for their breakthrough research and innovation creating a platform for large-scale separation, isolation, purification and applications of chemical components in wood.They have created an understanding of the fundamental chemistry of spruce tree knots, for example the part of the branches that is embedded in the stem. They developed technical separation methods to extract tree knots from the pulping process and to isolate and purify chemicals from the tree knots, opening the field for many potential applications and uses. An example is hydroxymatairesinol (HMR) as a human dietary supplement.The selective removal of knots from the pulping process brings opportunities for additional benefits by reducing process disturbances, reducing the use of bleaching chemicals and energy, and allowing more consistent quality of the paper products to be produced.By methodical research of the highest quality, the Laureates have significantly contributed to creating a platform for the forest products industry to improve and broaden its role and commercial prospects with a range of new products and implications, such as chemicals, energy, production efficiency and sustainability.Professor Holmbom has concentrated his research at the molecular level to gain understanding of the complex chemistry involved in paper making. His key expertise relates to versatile applications of wood chemistry, with special focus on wood extractives, and innovations based on interactions between chemistry and process. Bjarne Holmbom’s special interest in recent years has been the rich source of lignans in tree knots and stemwood. The easily extracted lignans may be used as active components in for example functional foods and organic biocides.Based on an original idea by Christer Eckerman, a technical method for the separation of knots from oversized chips was developed and patented. The method is based on the known fact that oversized chips are rich in dense knot-containing wood. This chip fraction is ground to splinters which are dried and then sedimented in water; the knotwood material sinks and is collected. The floating normal stemwood can also be collected and used in the pulping operation.Following the original discovery, Holmbom and co-workers have also further promoted lignans and other extractives present in various wood species in a large number of publications. A wider selection of spruce trees taken from various locations as well as pine and fir species have been analysed and the amounts of numerous compounds have been determined in knotwood and stemwood. Many of the extracts that have been isolated have also been tested for their antimicrobial activity. More recently, the possibility of using HMR as a base compound for the production of other valuable lignans has been explored. /AA",Engelska nyheter

of 2008. Net sales and profit before tax rose compared with the same

period previous year.","Net sales rose seven percent compared with the same period previous year. Profit before tax rose four percent to SEK 1,946m (1,863). Also profit for the period rose, with seven percent to SEK 1,537m (1,434). “The SCA Group increased its net sales by seven percent, driven by acquisitions and favourable sales development, especially in emerging markets, where sales growth was 14 percent. These factors, along with an improved product mix, contributed to eight percent growth in operating profit,” comments Jan Johansson, president and CEO of SCA.Johansson continues, “Following a good start to the year for most of our businesses, we saw an increase in raw material and energy costs. In our packaging business, this resulted in a five percent drop in operating profit, excluding the divestment of the North American packaging operations, despite price increases which generated an earnings effect of SEK 500m. Operating profit for the tissue operations rose a full 61 percent as a result of acquisitions and price increases. Operating profit for Personal Care products improved by ten percent as a result of higher volume and an improved product mix. Operating profit for Forest Products was level with the same period a year ago.” “We are seeing an economic downturn in the US and in certain segments in Europe in the wake of financial concerns at the same time that raw material prices continue to rise. This is making it difficult to compensate for higher raw material costs in all areas of operation. Consumer segments have been affected to a lesser degree by the economic change. We see continued growth in our hygiene segments,” said Johanson.“We are conducting long-term work on enhancing growth and profitability at SCA. I am confident about this work at the same time that we still face certain challenges in parts of our business in the near term from rising raw material and energy prices,” Johansson concludes./KB",Engelska nyheter

Pine sawlog prices declined 22 percent, softwood pulpwood prices were down 20 percent, and hardwood pulpwood costs fell just over 15 percent.The major reasons for the price declines were an improved log supply thanks to favorable logging conditions and a substantial reduction in log exports, Wood Resource Quarterly reports. Russian export taxes for softwood logs increased from 20 to 25 percent of log value as April 1, 2008. This timber tariff has gone up from 6.5 percent two years ago, and is planned to reach 80 percent in January 2009. Sawmills in Finland, China and Japan are most directly impacted by the higher costs of Russian softwood logs, as they have relied on imports from their neighbor for many years.Finland, the largest importer of logs in Europe, imported  37 percent less softwood logs from Russia in 2007 as compared to 2006. Although softwood log exports to China were down in the first quarter 2008 compared to the same quarter last year, China has increased its reliance of Russian logs from a mere 530,000 m3 in 1997 to a record of 23 million m3 in 2007.Although right now, importers of Russian logs are being most impacted by the log tax hikes, many forest companies in other parts of Europe and North America will be indirectly effected as the currently Russian-supplied pulp and lumber manufacturers will search for wood raw-material elsewhere, Wood Resource Quarterly reports. Many forest companies in Europe, particularly in the Nordic countries and the Baltic States are now adjusting their wood raw-material supply strategies, near-term and longterm, as the costs of logs from Russia are likely to increase further.  /AA",Engelska nyheter

The start-up  is scheduled for the fall this year.Particular to the new OptiCell flotation cell is its linear and elliptical design and high technology injector. The new cell design is based on computational fluid dynamics. The elliptical and linear shape has traditionally proven to provide excellent characteristics for smooth flow velocities, allowing maximized bubble rise and efficient froth removal. Another feature is the new up-flow feed injector that enables ideal flow pattern before aeration and less piping with easy operation and maintenance. As a result of the newly developed injector design the maximal air generation is about 20 percent more compared to conventional technology. A higher share of energy can therefore be utilized in creating turbulence to break down the size of air bubbles.The Stora Enso Maxau Mill is located directly on the Rhine near Karlsruhe, where it has its own port. The mill uses recovered paper as its main raw material. The mill’s deinking facility has a capacity of 380,000 tons per year. The site also includes a ground wood mill as well as a thermomechanical pulping system (for the processing of sawmill scraps). The three paper machines in Maxau produce approximately 700,000 tons of magazine paper and newsprint a year. /AA",Engelska nyheter

as the LignoBoost brand and its related know-how. Personnel or

facilities are not included in the transaction. In addition Metso and

STFI-Packforsk have signed a research and development agreement related

to LignoBoost technology. Both agreements come into force with

immediate effect. The value of the transaction will not be disclosed.

Lignoboost will become part of Metso Power, a part of Metso Paper

business area. 

The acquisition supports Metso’s profitable growth strategy and opens

an interesting biofuel business opportunity within pulping processes. 

""We see great value in getting a process with such high future

expectations. It complements our present solutions offering in an

excellent way. LignoBoost has the best chances of being further

commercialized for industrial applications in a global company such as

Metso"", says Lennart Ohlsson, President of Metso Power.

in pulp mill's power generation or in lime kilns. LignoBoost gives

Metso’s customers the possibility to increase the capacity of a pulp

mill and turn pulp mills into significant energy suppliers. At the same

the extracted lignin is also of interest for other process industries

as a raw material for plastics, coal fibers and chemicals. 

The LignoBoost technology has proven its technical maturity over

several years of research and laboratory testing as well as during

operation in an industrial-size demonstration plant integrated into the

pulping process of Nordic Paper - Bäckhammar, Kristinehamn, Sweden. The

demonstration plant will remain in the possession of STFI-Packforsk.

He urges parties in the paper industry to work together to attract qualified personnel. “As an industry, we must continue to cooperate to enhance our attractiveness as a sector.” Kalervo Turtola from the consultant company Bain Consulting agrees that the paper industry has a problem. “There is certainly a problem with the age structure in the industry, but the greatest concern is that talented individuals want to work in growth sectors,” says Turtola. However, Turtola does not agree with Ågren that an industry-wide approach is the right path to rectify the problem.  “I think that it is more important to work at a company level. It is easier to strengthen the image of an individual company than an industry in crisis,” says Turtola./KB",Engelska nyheter

39597.5038078704,Voith’s new dryer technology soon on the market,"May 29, 2008–Voith Paper’s new BoostDryer technology will soon be on the market. The first pilot plant is now being placed in commercial operation at a paper mill in Germany and it is expected that Voith will announce the first order for a BoostDryer plant within one or two months. ","The BoostDryer comprises a novel steam-heated cylinder that permits a

very high heat flux due to its special design. The paper web is pressed

onto the cylinder by a water-cooled pressure hood. This improves

contact and increases drying capacity.

“Drying rates are achieved that correspond to three to four times those

of a conventional dryer. In addition, the compression produces high

strength values and improves the smoothness and surface properties of

the paper,” says Jörge Lampe of Voith Paper to Nordic Paper Journal at

a press conference held at the SPCI Trade Show in Stockholm.

With BoostDryer, paper mills can eliminate bottlenecks and increase

drying capacity without extending the length of the paper machine. In

future, it will be possible to build new paper machines shorter than

today’s PMs as a result of the BoostDryer technology. ",Engelska nyheter

The growth region Brazil a struggle is under way for labor among the rapidly expanding companies, relates Chritiane Yoshinaga. HR Manager of Stora Enso in Brazil, who spoke at the SPCI Trade Fair in Stockholm today.","“There’s a battle on in Brazil for personnel,” explains Yoshinaga.

The level of education in Brazil is generally low, while at the same

time the pulp and paper industry is growing at an explosive rate in the

company. Consequently, the need for skilled personnel is high.

“It is difficult to find qualified personnel in the region. Moreover,

many of the well-educated move to other countries to work,” says

Yoshinaga.

A higher salary is not a sufficiently strong argument to recruit

personnel in Brazil today. “Research indicates that more than just

salary is needed to attract and retain personnel. Good leadership,

career possibilities and challenges are the areas valued today,”

contends Yoshinaga.

The search for personnel expands beyond the borders of Brazil today and

can require major financial investments. “I have seen companies offer

50% increases in salaries to retain personnel,” concludes Yoshinaga./KB",Engelska nyheter

39601.463287037,Global trade of woodchips reached new records in 2007,"June 2 2008  Pulpmills in both Europe and the Pacific Rim are increasingly sourcing their mills with  wood from fast-growing plantations. This has resulted in a major expansion of worldwide trade of both wood chips and pulplogs the past few years, according to the Wood Resource Quarterly.","Global trade of wood chips has more than doubled in 20 years, reaching 31 million tons in 2007. Just since 2003, total trade has increased by almost 30 percent. This development is the result of a tighter wood supply in close proximity to many pulpmills in the Northern Hemisphere, higher costs for locally sourced wood fiber and relatively lower-cost alternatives in new supply regions.The biggest increases in imports have been to Finland, Austria, Germany, Turkey, Canada and China. Trade of wood chips is still the highest in the Pacific Rim, where  imports to Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and China account for about 55 percent of the total  global trade and over 95 percent of water-born trade, Wood Resource Quarterly reports.Vietnam and Uruguay are two countries which have increased shipments of wood chips dramatically. Uruguay has expanded shipments of both Eucalyptus wood chip and pulpwood the past few years. In 2007, total wood chip exports were almost one million tons compared to virtually no chip exports at all five years ago. Practically all wood chips have been sent to pulpmills in Japan, Spain, Sweden and Finland. In addition to wood chips, Uruguay has also expanded exports of pulplogs from its plantations. In 2007, these shipments  reached 1.7 million m3, of which a majority has been destined for the Nordic countries and Southwest Europe (Portugal, France and Spain).Over the long-term, it can be expected that trade of wood chips will decline, as more pulp capacity will be added in regions with fast-growing plantations and pulpwood will be consumed locally, Wood Resource Quarterly notes. /AA",Engelska nyheter

The number is down somewhat from 2005 figures for the fair, when slightly more than 14,000 visits were recorded. The actual number of visitors is estimated to be a few thousand less, since many people generally attend the fair on more than one of the days.","The figure of 13,587 relates to the number of visits – not the number of visitors, since many people generally attend the fair on more than one of the days, thus registering several visits.

39618.4796180556,Log costs in Finland highest in the world,"June 19 2008  Finland is having some of the highest sawlog and pulpwood costs in the world, and log prices in Finland have increased dramatically.","In the first quarter of 2008, softwood and hardwood pulpwood prices in Finland reached an 18-year high (in Dollars) after having increased for ten consecutive quarters. Softwood pulpwood prices were 57 percent higher in 2008 than in 2006, while hardwood prices increased over 67 percent during the past two years, according to the market report Wood Resource Quarterly.The Finnish pulp industry now has the highest softwood pulplog costs of all the 16 regions tracked by the Wood Resource Quarterly, averaging over twice the wood costs for pulpmills in the US, Latin America and Oceania. Hardwood pulplog costs are the second highest in the world after Germany.The surge in wood costs cannot only be explained by the weakening US Dollar; higher costs in the local Euro are also contributing to the price increases. High wood costs in Finland are also the result of increased competition for logs in the domestic market because the availability of Russian logs is dwindling. The higher costs for Russian logs has resulted in increased imports of softwood logs from other countries from 1.8 million m3 in 2006 to over 2.8 million m3 in 2007. This trend away from Russia to Sweden and the Baltic States is likely to continue in the coming years.Private forest owners’ timber sales in Finland in the first quarter of this year were only half of the timber volume compared to a year ago, a clear sign that there will continue to be tight supply of logs in Finland and that both pulpmills and sawmills may be forced to reduce production in the coming months, Wood Resource Quarterly notes. /AA",Engelska nyheter

Operating profit was significantly below our expectations especially in Wood Products, whereas the rapid cost increases and strong Euro have hurt most of the paper and board businesses as well. The restructuring measures we launched in late 2007 are being implemented as planned; however, in the present environment they are clearly not enough,"" said Jouko Karvinen, CEO of Stora Enso.“Even with our strong overall energy balance, especially with biofuel-based energy, the 40% increase in oil and particularly gas prices in the past three months, in addition to the wood cost increases of the past two years, means we must take further actions. We have announced price increases in several paper and board grades to our customers. Escalating costs and potentially weakening demand will also require both temporary and permanent capacity reductions. These capacity adjustments are independent of the outcome of the Russian wood duty negotiations; they are needed because of unacceptable costs and the weak profitability in certain products and production lines. We will announce specific plans still during this current quarter. In parallel, we are preparing a second set of capacity reduction plans in case there is no concrete and cost-improving compromise on Russian duties soon,"" Karvinen continued.“In the challenging environment we expect our operating profit excluding non-recurring items and fair valuations for the third quarter of 2008 to be somewhat weaker than the second quarter of 2008. The weakening earnings will naturally also have a negative impact on the Group’s cash flow. We continue the policy of balancing financial prudence and cash preservation on the one hand, and investing selectively in attractive growth opportunities for the future on the other.""“In this reality it is clear that waiting for things to get better will do the Company nothing but great harm. This is especially true now that uncertainty about the market outlook has changed as we see the first clear signs of demand softness in certain grades. We will continue to take corrective actions as rapidly and efficiently as we can,” Jouko Karvinen concluded. /AA",Engelska nyheter

Five parameters – luminosity, colour, cleanliness, ink elimination and filtrate  darkening – are considered in a widely accepted standardized test, called Method 11. It is developed by the International Association of the Deinking Industry, Ingede.Following laboratory tests the results of the scorecard’s five parameters are weighted, according to their importance and displayed either numerically or graphically in a traffic light colour scheme. There are four categories of result – good, fair, poor and not suitable for deinking. In order to achieve the status of being “fair” or “good” in terms of deinkability, a printed product has to reach at least 51 out of 100 points. A score below zero in any one or more of the parameters leads to the overall assessment “not suitable for deinking”.

experienced intense margin pressure from the escalation of raw material

with the heaviest impact in April and May. However, by mid June, we

were able to offset these higher costs with sales prices increases and

we are seeing further significant sales price increases coming through

in July,” said Brendan Cummins, Chief Executive Officer.

The forecast for the second half of 2008 is not positive.

“Business conditions going into the second half clearly remain a

challenge.  We are experiencing deterioration in some markets,

particularly in Europe, however, we are also seeing continued robust

growth in other regions, notably in Asia, where we have a strong market

position. Overall, based on our current market forecasts, raw material

costs and foreign exchange rates; we believe the outlook we

communicated at the first quarter, is achievable with the margin

improvements that are coming through from the increased sales prices in

the second half.  However, should business conditions worsen further,

the results may be lower than we are currently anticipating,” continued

Cummins.

However, Ciba is planning to take action.

 “We are taking significant action to reshape the portfolio and focus

on areas of technological core strength in plastics, coatings and

water.  A number of options are being evaluated for the paper and

This will generate opportunities for the existing wood-based industry to conquer new markets and also create openings for new companies, business models and areas, according to STFI-Packforsk. For the existing wood-based industry, it is also a step towards the transformation into a modernized industry, by fostering new concepts and materials in a broad and innovative perspective.""It is very exiting that the European Commission has decided to fund this type of project. The targeted products in SustainComp open new possible business areas for the European forest based industry,"" says Mikael Ankerfors, Coordinator of SustainComp.""SCA has sustainability high on its agenda. We expect that SustainComp will find new renewable cost effective materials that can be implemented in existing manufacturing operations"", comments Folke Österberg, Director, Research Program, SCA R&D Centre, one of the project partners.In the wake of climate change and increasing oil prices, the demand for sustainable and light weight materials that can replace oil-based products has increased. At the same time, bioplastic production capacities are increasing. The combination of bioplastics and nanotechnology is an approach that meets the technical demands of replacing the oil-based materials with sustainable and renewable ones. /AA",Engelska nyheter
39689.4025347222,Cham Paper to divest Norwegian Hunsfos mill,"August 29 2008  The Swiss Cham Paper Group is searching for buyers for its Norwegian mill, specialty paper manufacturer Hunsfos.","The future for the mill appears uncertain following years of losses. One of the mill's three paper machines was stopped at the beginning of August, and 14 employees received redundancy notices. Hunsfos Fabrikker just outside Kristiansand in southern Norway was acquired by Cham Paper ten years ago. Since then, the mill has reported losses totaling nearly 720 million Norwegian Kroner, and the mill was ranked last in the Nordic Paper Journal’s profitability ranking pertaining to the 2006 fiscal year, with an operating margin of minus 38.3 percent. The decision to close down one of the paper machines and the owner’s desire to sell the mill came as a surprise to mill employees since the loss trend was broken during the last quarter of 2006, and the mill reportedly operated at a profit during 2007.

39689.5368518518,Increasing wood costs for pulpmills worldwide,"August 29 2008  Wood fiber costs increased in practically all major pulp-producing regions around the world in the second quarter, according to the market report Wood Resource Quarterly.","The global increase of wood fiber costs is both a result of a continued weakening of the US Dollar against most major currencies and because of higher transport costs for both pulpwood and wood chips, Wood Resource Quarterly writes. In the Nordic region, the Russian wood export tax is also influencing the wood costs for the pulp mills, Finnish forest industry analysts say.The wood costs, which typically account for almost 50 percent of the production costs for a pulpmill, often determine a region’s or company’s competitiveness. The average global conifer wood price reached a new all-time-high of 112.53 Dollars per oven-dry metric ton in second quarter. This was up eleven percent from 2007 and 26 pecent higher than two years ago. The only exception to this price trend was in North America, where softwood pulplog prices fell between one and six percent from the previous quarter, Wood Resources Quarterly reports.The largest price increases came in Europe, Brazil, Russia and Australia, where supply of both roundwood and chips became tighter. With the slump in the lumber markets in North America and Europe, the supply of residual chips from sawmills  continued to decline, resulting in increased competition and higher reliance on the more expensive wood fiber from roundwood.The higher cost of producing pulp the past few years has to a large extent been passed on to wood pulp consumers. Market pulp prices have almost doubled since 2003 and have this year reached the highest level in 13 years. /AA",Engelska nyheter

39696.6071412037,Global wood prices surging,"Sept 5 2008  Wood fiber prices worldwide have been rising steadily for the past six years, reaching record levels in the second quarter of this year.","Expanding demand for renewable energy may potentially drive prices even higher in many countries in the near future, according to Håkan  Ekström, president of Wood Resources International. Since 2002, global average prices for pulpwood have risen 67 percent for softwood and 64 percent for hardwood, in US Dollar terms.To date, most pulpwood has been consumed by the pulp and paper sector, with smaller amounts used to produce wood-based panels such as MDF (medium density fiberboard). The hot new market for wood fiber is that of biomass energy; demand in both Europe and  North America is expected to soar over the next five to ten years. With the supply of wood fiber relatively inelastic, at least in the short term, this sudden new demand would  normally be expected to push wood prices to unprecedented new heights.However, Håkan Ekström points out that the availability and cost of ocean transport may restrict international trade in wood fiber to a great extent.“A lot of new power projects are being developed with the expectation that 'waste wood' will be both relatively inexpensive and  vessels for transport will be readily available. Both assumptions may prove to be highly optimistic.” Ekström says.Pulpmills in both Europe and the Pacific Rim are increasingly sourcing their mills with wood from fast-growing plantations in the Southern Hemisphere. This has resulted in a major expansion of worldwide trade of both wood chips and pulplogs the past few years. Global trade of wood chips has more than doubled in 20 years, reaching 31 million tons in 2007. Just since 2003, total trade has increased by almost 30 percent. Wood Resources International, in cooperation with Dana Ltd and Pike & Co, is organizing a conference with the focus on bringing together plantation forestry owners, woodchip suppliers, transportation experts, and end-users, including pulp mills and  biomass buyers, in order to answer questions about global wood availability and costs.

39701.5057175926,UPM to close two mills in Finland,Sept 10 2008  UPM continues its restructuring measures and plans to close paper and pulp capacity in Finland.,"UPM is planning a closure of Kajaani paper mill and a closure of Tervasaari pulp mill in Valkeakoski, both closures by the end of 2008. UPM is also planning significant efficiency improvement of its Label Division in Europe during 2009–2010 and streamlining of operations in all business groups, units and functions.According to UPM, possibilities for profitable operations at the Kajaani paper mill have constantly weakened, due to the price development of wood and energy as well as the weak long term demand outlook for its main products. In the mill's main products, newsprint, the sustainable market structure is based on recycled fiber and location in the middle of the customer base. The Kajaani mill is distant from markets, and it uses virgin fiber. The mill uses more wood and energy per produced paper ton than any other UPM mill in Finland. The mill has become unprofitable despite many well completed efficiency improvements.""Both the mill management and personnel have worked hard for years to improve Kajaani mill's profitability. No stone has been left unturned and for that I want to give all employees full recognition. The external challenges have just become overwhelmingly big. We need to face the reality now and conclude that a paper mill operating in Kajaani is no longer viable"", Jussi Pesonen says.At the Kajaani mill, UPM has 670 employees, of which 535 at the paper mill. The mill's production capacity is 640,000 tons of newsprint, special newsprint and uncoated SC magazine papers. One newsprint machine has been idle since February. Through the closures, UPM plans to reduce 13 percent of its newsprint capacity in Europe, 25 percent of its special newsprint capacity and approximately nine percent of its SC paper capacity.According to the plan, UPM 's sawmill and wood procurement will continue operations in Kajaani.In UPM's view, profitability of pulp production will significantly decrease in Finland in the coming months. The main driver for this is the high price of Finnish wood fibre. UPM has to steer fibre to its bigger, newer and more competitive pulp mills in Finland. Tervasaari pulp mill is the smallest and oldest of UPM's Finnish pulp mills. UPM sees no signs of recovery of the fibre supply but estimates it to continue to be challenging. Tervasaari pulp mill has no prerequisites to operate profitably in the coming wood supply situation.Tervasaari pulp mill has an annual production capacity of 210,000 tons of pulp. In addition, Tervasaari mill operates three paper machines, which together have an annual production capacity of 370,000 tons of speciality papers. Tervasaari mill has 680 employees and the planned closure of pulp mill includes around 150 people.The planned closure of the pulp mill would reduce UPM's pulp production by ten percent. After that the company would still remain self-sufficient in chemical pulp.Tervasaari mill's three paper machines continue production with no change in their current product portfolio. In future, chemical pulp will be supplied to Tervasaari from UPM's other pulp mills in Finland.The planned closures would decrease UPM's wood consumption in Finland by 2 million cubic metres annually. This would not reduce the company's wood procurement in Finland. Instead UPM aims to increase the procurement in Finland. /AA",Engelska nyheter

Unfortunately, the short answer to this question is no, says Håkan Eström, President, Wood Resources International.The Russian forest industry has increased softwood roundwood consumption on average four million cubic meters per year the past five years, but because of poor infrastructure, lack of investment capital, corruption, burdensome bureaucracy, lack of respect for property rights and political uncertainty, it is not likely that the industry will be able to expand much more rapidly in the near future than it did the past five years. This is going to have huge negative ramifications for thousands of Russian loggers, forest managers, and workers involved in the transportation of wood, Wood Resource Quarterly reports.""The biggest changes in the Russian forest industry have come the past five years with substantially higher production of wood-based panels in particular. The pulp industry has not expanded as fast, although there are plans both for expansion of existing pulpmills and for new greenfield mills in the coming years. The area with the slowest growth has been that of lumber, with softwood production up only about 20 percent the past ten years, and hardwood lumber production even declining 70 percent. In summary, the only major expansion within the industry has occurred in sectors which account for only a small share of the total log consumption in Russia,"" Håkan Ekström explains.The Russian government’s involvement in the domestic log market will have unintentional consequences. Short-term, the effect of the Russian log export tax will be to reduced employment in the forest sector rather than to increase it; exactly the opposite  effect hoped for by the Federal Government when it decided to restrict log exports. /AA",Engelska nyheter
39716.5911805556,Arctic Paper to acquire Grycksbo and close Håfreström,Sept 25 2008  Arctic Paper acquires Grycksbo fine paper mill. Arctic Paper also plans to close its Håfreströms mill. Most of the current production in Håfreström will be moved to Grycksbo.,"The Arctic Paper group will be the new owner of Grycksbo Paper. The seller, the investment fundAccent Equity 2003, receives shares in Arctic Paper corresponding to roughly ten percent of the share capital. The necessary documentation for approval of theacquisition are being submitted to the relevant competition authorities.Arctic Paper also announces that the company is beginning negotiations with employee representatives regarding the closure of its Håfreström mill. Most of the current production in Håfreström, which has approximately 300 employees and a capacity of 160,000 tons on two paper machines, will be moved to Grycksbo. Håfreström has been operating at a loss for several years, mainly due to  high energy prices, which are the direct reason for the closure.”Making a decision to close a mill is very difficult. The employees are extremely competent, and together we have implemented comprehensive programs that have enhanced the mill’s prospects. But in the end what proved insurmountable was the high and increasing energy costs. Just in the last five years, Håfreström has made losses of several hundred million Kronor”, says Olle Grundberg, CEO of Arctic Paper.Grycksbo Paper has capacity of 260,000 tons per year, and is characterized by high efficiency both in terms of production and energy consumption. With the shift from Håfreström to Grycksbo, Arctic Paper increases its total production capacity by more than 120,000 tons, and enhances its position as a supplier of coated paper. Grycksbo has a very strong brand in GPrint.The aim is also to boost the sales of Grycksbo’s products, especially in Europe, by using Arctic Paper’s strong sales and marketing organization.”When we acquired Grycksbo from Stora Enso, the idea was to be part of the restructuring of the fine paper industry and ensure continued growth for Grycksbo. The mill fits very well into the Arctic Paper family. This deal brings Grycksbo and its employees the best possible structure to meet the future”, says Jan Ohlsson, CEO of Accent Equity Partners AB. /AA",Engelska nyheter

Earlier this year the construction of the world's first commercial plant for such production was finalized in Germany. The plant is currently in the commissioning phase. In the near future it will produce about 18 millions of liters BTL yearly.Norske Skog's recently formed biofuel-subsidiary, Xynergo, has the objective to evaluate and potentially establish one or two full-scale plants for production of BTL in Norway. The cooperation between Choren and Norske Skog means a strong alliance with competence over the entire value chain - from forestry feedstock input to synthetic biofuel output.""I have high expectations for the business opportunities inherent in production of BTL. The cooperation with Choren will allow Xynergo to speed up progress in the development of these plans,"" says Norske Skog's CEO, Christian Rynning-Tønnesen.Choren is developing plans for a final investment decision to be taken in 2009 on the world's first full-scale plant for production of BTL in Schwedt, Germany, with a targeted production of 270 million liters of synthetic biofuel annually. A similar plant in Norway would be able to cover about 14 percent of the total Norwegian diesel consumption for road transportation. This would reduce Norwegian CO2 emissions by up to 700,000 tons per year, corresponding to seven percent of the current total CO2 emissions from road traffic in Norway.Second-generation bio-fuel can reduce the total life-cycle CO2-emissions by up to 90 percent compared to fossil diesel.

The selective removal of knots from the pulping process brings opportunities for additional benefits by reducing process disturbances, reducing the use of bleaching chemicals and energy, and allowing more consistent quality of the paper products to be produced.""The awarded research holds promise of adding value and enhancing the image of our business as capable of bringing benefits to society. As such it will also serve as a pointer to the future of our business, demonstrating that new ground is still to be explored when it comes to more fully developing the forest products industry to sustainably serve future society,"" said Marcus Wallenberg, Chairman of the Marcus Wallenberg Foundation at the award ceremony in Stockholm. /AA",Engelska nyheter

The SACC has announced 2008 as “The Year of Going Green”. One the

highlights during the year was the New York Green Summit recently, when

a large number of representatives from the business community and

researchers gathered to discuss how sustainability should be part of a

company’s strategy and how a sustainable approach may contribute to

business.

In addition to Jan Johansson, speakers included executives from

companies such as Ericsson, Skanska, Volvo, Saab, and Vattenfall.

Jan Johansson’s speech had the theme “Green is still the color of

money, right?” in which he explained how SCA’s performance in

environmental and social issues contributes to its business.

“In the US we have built a very strong positioning around the

superiority and sincerity of our sustainability programs,” he said.

Customers are looking to us as leaders and also coming to us for advice

on how they can do better themselves on issues on sustainability and

some customers are affiliating themselves with SCA to further their own

sustainability positions.”

The strong environmental profile is one of the reasons companies like

Bunzl, YUM (Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, KFC) and Sodexo work with SCA, and in

Europe SCA won the contract to deliver bathroom tissue to the new

Wembley Stadium due to environmental performance.

During the Green Summit, Jan Johansson took the chance to emphasise the positive environmental impacts of productive forestry.

“We emphasized the fact that if half the world’s forests had the same

growth as Swedish forests, most of the carbon dioxide problem could be

solved since growing trees absorb large amounts of CO2.”

The first graduates will be leaving school in 2013.In practice, possessing versatile skills means that process employees have strong, “multidisciplinary” competence, which enables them to handle, on top of their regular manufacturing duties, the most common faults or other interruptions occurring at night or on the weekend.Because paper industry employees work in shifts, it is not necessary for one person to have competence in all matters, as workers with expertise in different areas can be included in one shift. Workers with versatile skills should also be capable of transferring to a different position within a shift roster or be prepared to receive training for new responsibilities if so agreed.The vocational subjects included in the new qualification focus on fostering competence in skills that are needed to support and maintain processes across the whole of the process industry. In addition to this, teaching of basic knowledge on, for example, physics and chemistry as well as safety skills will be strengthened.A substantial portion of the new qualification’s curriculum will be devoted to subjects that are compulsory to all students.

The Board’s sight is that the arrangement will significantly improve the business conditions for Stromsdal and make the company and its shares more attractive as an investment object, despite the significant dilution of ownership for the current shareholders.Stromsdal has signed a significant supply agreement, mainly for 2009, which is about five percent of next year’s volume target. The supply agreement is one of the biggest ever signed in Stromsdal’s history.Stromsdal's result for the third quarter shows a pre-tax loss of –2.8 million Euros (-1.2 million). The third quarter net sales were 13.3 million Euros (14.1 million). /AA",Engelska nyheter

UPM has reserved 1.5 million Euros to support the participation and material costs for retraining at a rate of up to 5,000 Euros per person.In addition, UPM will encourage affected personnel to create new businesses by offering start-up support. The company has booked one million Euros for this purpose. UPM's start-up support can be applied until the end of 2010. Maximum support for business is 20,000 Euros.In order to relieve the situation in Kajaani, where the mill will be closed, UPM will extend the re-employment obligation for local employees from nine months, obligated by law, to 15 months. UPM is committed to inform employees given notice about the company's vacancies to their home addresses and employment authorities at all the company's mill locations nine months beyond the above mentioned period.For employees moving to new UPM location, the company will cover relocation costs and a settling-in allowance equal to one month's remuneration.Retiring employees and employees given notice have the right to use the company's occupational health services for one year after the end of work relationship.

The implementation of the decisions made will reduce the number of UPM's employees in Finland by around 700 persons.","Financial prerequisites to continue the operations of the mills could not be found in the negotiations with employees. The slowing economy has further weakened the situation of these mills during the autumn.Possibilities for profitable operations at the Kajaani paper mill have constantly weakened due to the price development of wood and energy as well as the weak long term demand outlook for its main products. The mill is not competitive in the long term despite many well completed efficiency improvements. UPM's sawmill and wood procurement will continue operations in Kajaani.Profitability of pulp production has significantly decreased in Finland. The main driver for this is the high price of wood fibre. Tervasaari pulp mill is the smallest and oldest of UPM's Finnish pulp mills and it has no prerequisites to operate profitably in this wood supply situation. UPM steers fibre to its bigger, newer and more competitive pulp mills in Finland. Tervasaari mill's three paper machines continue operations. In future, chemical pulp will be supplied to Tervasaari from more competitive pulp mills in Finland.In Kajaani, the number of employees will reduce by 535 persons, around 100 through retirement.

39766.6501388889,Södra and Chalmers R&D program graduates its first doctor,"Nov 14 2008  Avancell has generated its first doctoral thesis, which investigates ways to improve the sulphate pulp cooking process. Johannes Bogren defended his doctoral thesis and thus became the first doctor to graduate within the framework of Södra’s research collaboration with the Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg.","In his thesis, entitled “Further insight into kraft cooking kinetics”, Bogren investigates ways whether further efficiency improvements can be made to the sulphate pulp cooking process. In the digester, carbohydrates undergo a comprehensive and undesirable reaction which prevents optimal use being made of the wood. In his thesis, Bogren aims to increase knowledge about the mechanisms that cause this degradation. His work will provide a tool to produce pulp with a higher carbohydrate content which could then be used to manufacture new products or further modify existing products. Such a breakthrough will be especially welcome at this time of increased competition in the pulp and paper industry, where there is an increasing need to make more efficient use of wood. “If the carbohydrates remain in the pulp it means less wood is consumed, which is good both for finances and sustainability,” says Bogren.  Johannes Bogren started his doctoral studies in 2004 and joined Avancell in 2005. He was the first of five doctoral students in this unique research cluster to defend his thesis. Avancell head Mats Wallin is very pleased with the efforts of the Södra doctoral students, and with the collaboration as a whole.  “Avancell gives us a toolkit to help us manipulate fibre properties in the future and it provides the base for our other Chalmers collaborations with Tetra Pak and SCA Personal Care,” he says, continuing: “This means that Avancell is strategically important for us. We started in 2005 and now it is time to harvest – next year another four doctoral theses will be presented.” Bogren starts his assignment at Södra Cell R&D in Väröbacka in December. As part of the R&D pulp technology department he will continue to put his theories into practice, as well as having the opportunity to take part in other projects. /AA",Engelska nyheter

39771.4260763889,Log costs falling in Russia,"Nov 19 2008  The Russian timber market has gone through a roller coaster ride the past tewlve months, with log costs reaching record highs in the fourth quarter of last year and then falling to two-year lows in the third quarter this year.","The log costs fell in Russia in the third quarter, as forest industry cut back production, Wood Resourcees International reports. Topping off the dramatic events as of late was the announcement by Prime Minister Vladimir Putin in early November that the long-awaited wood export tax, which would practically cease softwood log exports in January 2009, will be postponed for nine to twelve months.The Russian economy started to slow in the third quarter with reduced demand for lumber, both domestically and in the export market. So far, logging has declined by about nine percent in Russia, compared to last year.Softwood pulplog prices in northwest Russia fell by 13 percent in the third quarter to their lowest level since early 2007. With slowing demand for domestic wood fiber and and reduced consumption of wood fiber in Finland, the largest export market for Russian logs, it is probable that pulplog costs will continue to decrease slightly next year, according to Wood Resources Internationel.It is not to be expected that forest companies, which have relied on softwood logs from Russia, will abruptly change their long-term procurement strategy of reducing their dependence on Russian wood, based on the recently announced short-term delay in the hike of the Russian log tax. Softwood log shipments from western Russia to Finland will probably continue to decline, as Finnish companies are likely to consume less in 2009, and as domestic wood and imports from other countries around the Baltic Sea will be substituted for Russian logs, Wood Resources International writes. The major benefit for companies using Russian logs is that the transition period for becoming independent of this source has been prolonged by a few months. /AA",Engelska nyheter

The demand for M-real's main products in Europe was expected to remain relatively stable for the rest of the year. M-real has earlier stated that the operating result for the full year 2008 is expected to be weaker than in 2007. In the fourth quarter, the demand for M-real's main products has declined clearly more than the normally expected seasonality due to the weakening world economy. This has resulted in market-related curtailments at M-real's mills. The decline in market pulp prices has also weakened M-real's profitability more than expected, M-real writes in a press release. M-real's operating result, excluding non-recurring items, of the fourth quarter will be clearly weaker than in the third quarter.

39812.4687152778,Wood costs fell for many pulp mills during third quarter,Dec 30 2008  Wood fiber costs fell for the first time in many years in practically all major pulp producing regions around the world in the third quarter of 2008.,"The wood fiber cost drop was the result of two major factors, according to the market report Wood Resource Quarterly, namely a strengthening US Dollar against most major currencies, and a reduced demand for pulpwood.The average global softwood pulpwood price fell two percent to 110.43 Dollars per oven-dry metric ton in the third quarter of 2008. This was the biggest quarter-to-quarter decline since 2001. The average price was up eleven percent from 2007 and was 26 percent higher than two years ago. Despite the fall, the price was still the second highest ever recorded since 1988, when Wood Resource Quarterly started tracking global wood markets.In the third quarter of 2008 the softwood fiber costs were lower in practically all regions, except Norway, France and southern USA, where prices were higher because of tight supply.With the global decline in paper demand and many pulp mills cutting back production, it is likely that wood costs will continue down in early 2009, according to Wood Resource Quarterly.The average hardwood wood fiber cost was up almost two Dollars in t he third quarter, reaching a new record-high of 110.71 Dollars per oven-dry metric ton.

In addition, temporary employment contracts and subcontracting will be cut back as projects in progress are completed. As part of the adaptation measures, Pöyry has decided to initiate statutory employee negotiations in the Finland-based business units of the Forest Industry and Construction Services business groups. The statutory negotiations are concerned with temporary and permanent lay-offs, and other actions to adapt operations to the current market situation.The specific need for and duration of temporary lay-offs, possible permanent lay-offs and other actions will be determined in detail as negotiations proceed.

The ending of a full tax break for first thinning operations at the end of August spurred the supply of fiberwood to record levels, and this caused purchases to increase to a record.In 2008, the price of pine and birch fiberwood as well as birch logs increased by four to five percent from the previous year.The market situation for pulp, paper and wood products affects short-term demand for timber, but the significance of domestic wood raw material for the Finnish forest industry will grow over the long run, according to the Finnish Forest Industries Federation.

This was 32 percent less than in January 2008, but 16 percent more than in December. Log procurements were down 21 percent and fiberwood purchases were down 37 percent from January 2008.","The decrease in purchases was due both to the economic slump and the harvesting of winter felling sites that had been procured in earlier years. Winter felling sites can be logged and the wood transported away from them only after the ground freezes. The weather has been sufficiently cold this winter to enable logging activities in these difficult sites.The stumpage prices of wood have declined slightly. The January stumpage prices of logs fell by about ten percent and fiberwood stumpage prices by between six and nine percent from last December.The prices of wood raw material in the main competing countries have fallen more rapidly than in Finland.Although wood demand has temporarily fallen because of the economic slump, the industry needs to secure an increasing amount of timber in Finland over the long term, according to the Finnish Forest Industries Federation.",Engelska nyheter

The global wood pellet industry has developed remarkably fast and is increasingly competing with the pulp industry for wood raw-material.,"The global wood pellet industry has developed remarkably fast, evolving from being practically non-existent 15 years ago to being an important wood fiber consumer which is increasingly competing with pulp and wood-panel industry for wood raw-material, Wood Resource Quarterly reports.The global pellet production was close to ten million tons 2008, according to the Wood Resource Quarterly. It is estimated that the production will double over the next four to five years, and some industry experts forecast an annual growth of 25-30 percent globally over the next ten years. Europe is currently the major market for pellets, but the interest for non-fossil fuels in North America is growing. The expected change in energy policy in the USA could result in increased imports of pellets from Canada to the US, which will eventually diminish the flow of biomass from North america to Europe.The major raw-material for pellet manufacturing has traditionally been sawdust and shavings from the sawmilling industry. As this source has started to tap out, there is now an increased interest in searching for alternative fiber. It can be expected that European pellet manufacturers will increasingly use forest residues, urban wood waste, and fast-growing tree species. They will also begin compete more aggressively with pulp mills for pulp logs, Wood Resource Quarterly writes.A surprisingly large share of the global pellet production is being shipped to markets outside the producing country, also intercontinentally.The rapid expansion in global trade of biomass - both wood chips and pellets - is likely to continue over the next three to five years, according to Wood Resource Quarterly.",Engelska nyheter

The chair makes its world premiere at the Milan Furniture Fair in late April.,"Södra has developed a chair made from pulp in collaboration with Swedish design and architect firm Claesson Koivisto Rune. The chair is designed for children. It is durable and waterproof, despite having the look and feel of ordinary paper. It is recyclable, environmentally-friendly, stackable and colourful.After several years’ research and development, the chair is about to make its world debut. The architect and design firm had long wanted to make a chair from paper. Together with Södra and research company STFI-Packforsk, Claesson Koivisto Rune experimented and tested the suitability of the material for use in a tough and practical chair for children. The chair has been named Parupu after the Japanese word for pulp.The material is a speciality pulp from Södra Cell combined with PLA, a biodegradable plastic made from maize starch and cane sugar. This makes it an eco-friendly, recyclable material that can replace plastic. The chair can be wiped clean, and is designed to last a childhood, withstanding a lot of play. The chair’s base material, which can be moulded and could potentially replace plastic in a number of applications, has been named DuraPulp. DuraPulp has the look and feel of paper. But a couple of millimetres in thickness is enough to support the weight of a person. It can be left outdoors for several years without degrading.“Parupu is the first product made from this type of material, which consists entirely of renewable cellulose,” says Karin Emilsson, director of technology and R&D manager at Södra. “DuraPulp is also suitable for producing quality packaging and labels, and can be run perfectly well in a normal paper machine. Our hope is that the chair will create interest and ideas amongst our existing customers as well as leading to discussions with new customer groups and new markets.”Södra is presenting Parupu at Superstudio in Milan in conjunction with the Furniture Fair and Design Week, 22–28 April.",Engelska nyheter

39917.4087847222,SCA innovation helps conserve bird life,April 9 2009  SCA Packaging Hungary has developed a new solution to protect bird life: the Hirundobox. This innovation enables a comfortable stay for the animals during their ringing while migrating to Africa.,"At the end of summer and at the beginning of autumn swallows, for example the barn swallow (hirundo rustica) flock together before their long trip to Africa. At the same time, bird ringers come together to mark the swallows. The ringing helps re-finding the birds in order to study their life. During the day, the birds hunt for insects but at sunset they spend the night in large reeds. So ringing lasts into the night. But they must not be set free after the ringing as they won’t find their resting place for the night and maybe fall prey to night predators. Therefore swallows have to spend the night at ringing stations.In the course of capturing large flocks it has been impossible to manage the birds’ safe and comfortable stay. So it was necessary to find a new solution to speed up the ringing. SCA Packaging’s Hungarian Design Center therefore developed the Hirundobox, which fulfils birds’ needs and meets the ringers’ expectations at the same time.",Engelska nyheter

The main reason is the mill's high eucalyptus wood costs.","Operations at the mill have been at a standstill since December last year. A total of 155 employees are affected by the closure.Factors contributing to the closure decision are the mill's high eucalyptus wood costs in comparison with its competitors in general and in particular those in the Southern hemisphere, and on-going investments in environmental measures, which would be expected to involve additional costs of around 80 million Kronor this year. Energy costs are also too high, because the mill uses older technology and is relatively small.Rottneros has been trying to sell the mill for about a year but has not succeeded. The Group has worked with Spanish authorities to find a solution for the mill's future, but this has also been unsuccessful. These efforts are, however, continuing, although the focus has shifted away from sulphate pulp production.Rottneros' eucalyptus pulp customers have been informed about the situation at the mill, and the closure of Miranda is not expected to result in any disruption of their operations, according to Rottneros.“It is regrettable that we cannot continue to operate the mill in Miranda, but in the current situation it is not possible to resume operations. The problem is primarily structural in nature and is not the result of the economic climate. The pulp and paper industry in Spain and Portugal is too large in relation to the wood supply, which is driving up prices in the long term to a level that is too high,"" says Rottneros CEO, Ole Terland.The production unit for Rottneros' food packaging division, SilviPak will also be affected when the mill is liquidated.

develop the new direct drive technology. Now, after many years of

intensive development, the technology is becoming an industrial

standard and brought to global commercial success by the recognized

suppliers for the pulp and paper industry. This opens significant opportunities for new design concepts and process configurations of paper making lines with advantages related to the investment, operation, product quality, ergonomics and environmental impact of the paper making process, The Marcus Wallenberg Foundation writes in a press release.The Direct Drive System (DDS) is radically renewing the traditional drive technology. The innovation is based on the Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor technology and is a true breakthrough innovation on the industrial scale. The DDS provides better torque characteristics, very precise speed control and high efficiency without the need for gearboxes, pulse encoders and auxiliary components. It gives freedom to create new innovative machine design concepts and process configurations, which require less space, simpler machine layouts, fewer components, less civil work and lower investment costs. The innovation provides better runnability with less frequent web breaks, better availability of the paper machine with fewer mechanical failures and less maintenance, better overall efficiency with minimum downtime and reduced lifecycle costs.The environmentally sound solution reduces electrical energy and oil consumption, reduces noise levels and is more ergonomic and safe for the operators. If applied to all paper machines with a wire width exceeding five meters, DDS would have the potential to reduce energy consumption by approximately 400 GWh in Europe and more than 1,200 GWh in the world.Jouni Ikäheimo is the leader for engineering and construction of permanent magnet motors at ABB Motors in Finland, and is an inventor in the area of permanent magnet motors.

39972.579525463,Fiber costs rising for wood pellets manufacturers,"June 8 2009  The competition for wood raw-material in Europe has been intensifying the past few years, and fiber costs are rising also for wood pellets manufacturers in Europe as the industry is expanding.","The competition for wood raw-material in Europe has been intensifying the past few years as sawmills, wood-panel manufacturers, pulpmills and bio-energy facilities expanded capacity during 2006 and 2007 and therefore increased the usage of roundwood and wood residues. Lately, the pulp market has weakened resulting in lower demand and prices for pulpwood in all countries in Europe. However, the decline has been less pronounced in markets where the pellet industry has a strong presence.The increased demand for biomass from the energy sector has not only had an impact on prices of residual chips from sawmills (wood chips, sawdust and shavings) but also of small-diameter logs, which have increasingly been utilized for energy generation. These developments have been particularly prominent in Germany and Sweden the past year. In Germany, prices for sawdust, wood chips and hardwood logs have converged during 2008 and 2009, and were in the first quarter practically the same (measured in dry tons), as reported in the Wood Resource Quarterly.In Sweden, small logs that would typically go to pulpmills have in recent months been sold to energy plants. With the demand and prices for pulpwood being in decline and the consumption of ""energy wood"" steadily rising, competition for smaller logs has intensified and it is expected that volumes of wood chips and logs bound for energy facilities will increase, thus potentially decreasing that going to pulpmills in the future. The rise in demand for forest biomass, including branches, stumps and tops will encourage more intensive management schemes with higher utilization of the forest resources not only in Sweden but in the rest of Europe as well.With the energy sector emerging as a new and aggressive market player, floor prices for wood chips and pulplogs are not expected to ever return to the low levels of the late 1990's again. The increased competition for raw-material between the biomass sector, the composite board manufacturers and the pulp industry will result in relatively high fiber costs even in weak markets for forest products in the future. The recent evolution of the wood raw-material market in Europe is not unique to this continent but can be expected to take place in North America as well in the coming years, Wood Resource Quarterly writes.",Engelska nyheter

39975.581400463,New sensor technology,June 11 2009  Voith has developed a new sensor that is able to measure formation directly in the wire section. The company also recently launched a new technology for reliable web break detection.,"Formation is crucial to quality in the paper manufacturing process. Until now, formation measurement has been problematic, especially in the production of board and packaging grades. Measurement could be done before the reel with commercially available sensors, but there the product was already multi-layered. Now Voith Paper Automation has developed a new formation sensor, called OnV FlocSpotter, that makes much earlier measurement possible, directly in the wire section.With multi-layer machines, formation of each individual layer can thus be inspected separately on the wire fabric before it is joined together with the other layers.Voith has also developed a new technology for reliable web break detection. The web break detectors available on the market today do not function 100 percent reliably in single-tier dryer sections. They cause problems, if there is too little color contrast between the paper web and the dryer fabric. In addition, false detections occur with transparent paper webs, for example with low basis weight or with high moisture content. Voith Paper claims thet the new OnC WebDetect is a more reliable solution. The measuring principle of the sensor is based on a spectroscopic procedure that takes into consideration the special optical characteristics of the paper web and the dryer fabric.",Engelska nyheter

39980.601724537,"Billerud's products have positive climate impact, new study says","June 16 2009  A new study by IVL, the Swedish Environmental Research Institute, reveals that Billerud's products have a positive climate impact.","Billerud's products cause very low emissions of greenhouse gases during their life cycles, because they are produced at energy-efficient mills powered by biofuel. The raw materials are taken from wellmanaged, expanding forests that consume large amounts of carbon dioxide. Billerud's products are therefore good for the global climate. That's the conclusion of a new study by IVL Swedish Environmental Research Institute.  The new study is a Carbon Footprint analysis that summarises the emissions of greenhouse gases created during the full life cycle of Billerud's products. This includes all raw materials, production, distribution and consumption, and what happens to the product after being used.  ""The purpose of the study is mainly to provide accurate information for our customers who can then work out the carbon footprint of their own products. The results show that from a climate perspective our products are very good. This is because of the carbon dioxide consumed in the forest and the energy-efficiency of our mills,"" comments Patrik Bosander, project manager at Billerud AB.  During its life time, a carrier bag made of Billerud paper causes fossil emissions of around 20 grams of carbon dioxide and consumption in the forest of 137 grams of carbon dioxide. Consumption of carbon dioxide is thus greater than the fossil emissions during the full life cycle, which is why the carrier bag has a positive climate impact.Billerud is a member of the Swedish Forest Industries Federation, which targets a 20 percent reduction of carbon dioxide emissions by 2020.",Engelska nyheter

39993.43875,ABB introduces new optical caliper sensor,"June 29 2009  ABB, the pioneer in Quality Control System, introduced its ground-breaking new optical caliper sensor at the Zellcheming Expo in Wiesbaden, Germany.","This new sensor, the latest in ABB’s 50-year history of pioneering on-line paper quality measurements, finally provides papermakers with the precision tool to measure and control caliper even for some quite demanding paper grades. ABB has developed the sensor based on revolutionary optical technology to measure caliper online with unrivaled accuracy and stability.Accurate caliper measurement and control are critical for defining paper quality and achieving customer satisfaction. Traditionally this has been achieved through the use of dual-sided contacting caliper sensors, but some paper applications pose severe challenges for contacting caliper measurement technology. For this reason, paper makers have been asking for a new type of caliper measurement, which overcomes the weaknesses associated with contacting caliper. ABB's new optical on-line measurement measures caliper without two-sided contact of the sheet, and without laser triangulation and the inherent inaccuracies that arise from penetration of the laser light into the sheet surface. The new sensor uses a different optical approach which provides greatly improved measurement accuracy and stability. The sensor is ideal for applications where the sliding skis of traditional caliper sensors gives rise to problems. The new optical caliper sensor is based on a confocal displacement measurement technique. The same technology has made recent advances in microscopy, thin-film research and semiconductor manufacturing.",Engelska nyheter

Only six companies earned a return of ten percent or more in 2008, compared to 14 in 2007.""The sharp decline is mainly due to the impact of losses realized by major players in many of the mature markets as a result of low demand, goodwill and fixed asset impairments, restructuring, severance and high operating costs,"" says said Craig Campbell, leader of PwC's Performance Improvement practice for the global forest and paper industry, and author of the PwC survey. ""This year's Survey results reflect the significant challenges faced by the sector, with the PwC Top 100 companies' net income sliding deep into the red, as well as return on equity and ROCE falling sharply from the already low levels seen in 2007.""SCA was the most profitable European company in 2008 with net income of 857 million Dollars (1.1 billion 2007). SCA's net income benefited from its strong exposure to the less-cyclical hygiene segment.The big story in Europe in 2008 was cuts in production and capacity nearly across the board. Temporary and permanent reductions in production capacity have improved the supply and demand balance in the paper industry, especially in newsprint, magazine and coated fine papers.""Despite massive efforts to reduce capacity, it will take some time to establish a stable supply and demand balance in the European market.""

40000.3708217593,Voith introduces AquaFlow and SolarFlow range for suction roll covers,July 6 2009  Voith Paper has developed the new polyurethane suction roll covers AquaFlow and SolarFlow.,"To ensure efficient dewatering Voith Paper has developed the new polyurethane suction roll covers AquaFlow and SolarFlow. With the help of an innovative bonding system they achieve highest dry content and also save energy, Voith Paper says in a press release.Aircraft and automotive industries are using the Interpenetrated Network (IPN) technology. Now also Voith Paper is using this innovative bonding system (WebNet technology) for suction press roll covers. The benefits of WebNet are tremendous, according to a Voith spokesman. Due to the three-dimensional linking of the polymers, the bonding of the functional layer with the roll shell is substantially improved. Thus now the covers have better temperature stability and higher impact resistance against mechanical stress and chemical attack.The new structure of the polyurethane functional layer permits deeper grooves for even more efficient dewatering. This means that the AquaFlow grooves can now be 2.3 mm deep and the groove width will be between 0.5 and 0.9 mm. The land area width will be 2.0 to 2.5 mm. SolarFlow has even deeper grooves - up to 3.0 mm deep with a width of 0.4 to 0.9 mm and land area of between 1.8 to 2.5 mm. Due to the deeper grooves the storage volume of the covers is enlarged, and the water can be removed faster to the saveall pan.This leads to efficient nip dewatering with reduced hydraulic nip pressure. Roll covers with additional blind drilling may no longer be necessary. Furthermore it may be possible to remove uhle boxes for felt conditioning.",Engelska nyheter

The innovation is based on the Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor technology and is a true breakthrough innovation on the industrial scale. The DDS provides better torque characteristics, very precise speed control and high efficiency without the need for gearboxes, pulse encoders and auxiliary components. It gives freedom to create new innovative machine design concepts and process configurations, which require less space, simpler machine layouts, fewer components, less civil work and lower investment costs. The innovation provides better runnability with less frequent web breaks, better availability of the paper machine with fewer mechanical failures and less maintenance, better overall efficiency with minimum downtime and reduced lifecycle costs.The environmentally sound solution reduces electrical energy and oil consumption, reduces noise levels and is more ergonomic and safe for the operators. If applied to all paper machines with a wire width exceeding 5 metres, DDS would have the potential to reduce energy consumption by approximately 400 GWh in Europe and more than 1,200 GWh in the world. This would give savings equal to about one coal power plant in Europe and two globally.“The awarded achievement is a fascinating case of innovative thinking and entrepreneurship, providing opportunities for significant reductions of cost, energy consumption and climate change impact of the paper making process,” said Marcus Wallenberg, Chairman of the Marcus Wallenberg Foundation at the award ceremony in Stockholm.The winners, who are working with ABB in Helsinki and Vasa in Finland, participated in a symposium in Stockholm on September 29, entitled ""What kind of R&D can make a difference?""",Engelska nyheter

40143.6109259259,SunPine first with biodiesel from tall oil,Nov 26 2009  Swedish SunPine is aiming to be the first company worldwide producing biodiesel from tall oil.,"At the company’s site in Piteå in northern Sweden, the building activity is intense. In the spring next year the plant will be ready and the first tall oil diesel produced. At the Preem refinery on the Swedish west coast the tall oil diesel will then be upgraded to a high quality green diesel, Nordic Paper Journal/Nordisk Papperstidning reports in its latest issue.“The tall oil diesel is unique in that the feedstock originates from the forest and that it can be blended into petro-based diesel fuel in higher percentages than ordinary biodiesel”, says Magnus Wikman, CEO of SunPine. “It also gives more energy and lower emissions than most other green diesel blends.”Normally a maximum of five percent biodiesel is blended into diesel fuel. Preem’s new green diesel, based on the tall oil diesel, will contain up to 20 percent green component. In this way the projected production of SunPine of 100,000 cubic meters tall oil diesel per year will become 500,000 cubic meters per year of ready fuel, more than ten percent of the total Swedish diesel consumption.The new green diesel can be used in all diesel engines and does not have the drawbacks of the traditional biodiesel such as bacterial growth during storage, according to SunPine. It was only five years ago that the research started that created the foundation for the SunPine product. Behind the idea stands Lars Stigsson, who was also instrumental in the founding of Chemrec, which hass developed a unique technology for gasification of black liquor. Already at the outset Lars Stigsson predicted the criticism directed against production of biodiesel from food crops. It became the driving force to search after other feedstock that could replace fossil fuels. In the laboratory he, together with leading researchers in chemical technology, started studying the byproducts of the forest industry. “It has been possible to realize our project quite quickly,” notes Wikman, who has been directing the development the last couple of years. “Many other initiatives for second generation green diesel are still at the research stage. The tall oil is a relatively easy feedstock compared to producing the fuel directly from wood or other biomass. This in combination with a skilled team researching and developing the process has made it possible to progress rapidly.”SunPine was created in 2006. Current owners each with 20 percent equity include oil company Preem, Sveaskog (the largest forest owner in Sweden), and Södra. The remaining 40 percent of the shares are held by Lars Stigsson through his company Kiram AB.",Engelska nyheter

Installation is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2010 in connection with the annual maintenance stoppage.""The increased capacity for evaporation means that more of the mill's process water can be evaporated, which in its turn makes it possible to recover and burn the organic material. This increases Vallvik's output of bioenergy,"" says Ole Terland, CEO of Rottneros.""What's more, by using special equipment, steam from the evaporation is divided into the bio gas that is burned and the water vapour that is condensed into pure water.

Research has shown the potential of saving as much as five percent of fiber raw material. For an average Nordic board mill (500,000 tons per year), this could mean saving some 125 million Kronor per year.

40288.3890277778,Cepifine supports EU investigation of subsidies to Chinese paper producers,"April 20 2010  The European Association of Fine Paper Manufacturers, Cepifine, supports an EU investigation of subsidies to Chinese coated fine paper producers.","The European Commission published Saturday the notice of initiation of an anti-subsidy investigation of coated fine paper (CFP) imports from China.  This investigation follows the opening on February 18 of an anti-dumping investigation of imports of the same product.“These investigations are essential because of strong evidence of dumping, which is aggravated and spurred on by massive subsidies by the Chinese government to build up national champions with huge excess capacity,” said Frank Leerkotte, Managing Director of Cepifine. ""The EU industry could not wait any longer to request these investigations due to the pace of the increase in imports of dumped and subsidized CFP from China and the negative impact they are having in the European market.” “European producers are clearly in the path of an oncoming flood of subsidized imports which are entering the EU market at industry-destroying prices.  The increased Chinese production will continue to pour into the EU, and the subsidized prices will overwhelm the Union producers unless appropriate anti-subsidy measures are imposed quickly,” Leerkotte continued.Despite global overcapacity, Chinese producers are set to add nearly six million tons of capacity in the next three years, more than doubling current production.  That increase alone is equivalent to 120 percent of EU consumption in 2009. The rise of unfair imports is jeopardizing European industry and jobs, according to Cepifine. “Without EU intervention the European industry will rapidly be supplanted by Chinese manufacturers. Once domestic competition is eliminated the Chinese would freely raise prices,” Frank Leerkotte said.As already established by the US government on 2 March, Chinese CFP producers receive substantial subsidies, which encourage over-production and exports. The US government is due to issue its findings on the dumping case within weeks. As a result of the US actions, unfairly traded Chinese products going to the US will necessarily be redirected to Europe.",Engelska nyheter

When increasing the share of bioenergy, it is extremely important to safeguard the forest industry's raw material supply.“The Government's stance on the building of more nuclear power will, when implemented, lead to an improvement in the forest industry's operating and investment prerequisites in Finland. Building more nuclear power provides the forest industry with the ingredients for developing diverse processing operations and increasing the utilisation of forest energy,” said Finnish Forest Industries Federation Chairman, Kari Jordan, CEO of Metsäliitto.The production volumes and electricity consumption of the forest industry's competitive units will grow over the long term in spite of the ongoing structural change. Forest industry corporations estimate that they will require 27-28 terawatt-hours of electricity in 2020, that is as much as they consumed before the onset of the recession.The forest industry's grid electricity need will also grow in the future, because increasing the value-added input and the manufacture of new products will lead to a rise in electricity consumption. If three to five biorefineries are built in Finland, they will together consume 1.5-2.5 terawatt-hours of grid electricity annually.“It is extremely important that the forest industry's raw material supply is safeguarded in the follow-up drafting of bioenergy subsidy decisions as promised by the Government. Subsidies must not steer processable wood into combustion,” Kari Jordan underlined.""The government's political decision on nuclear power is positive. On the other hand, the government's package to support renewable energy production invokes serious concerns for the availability and price of wood biomass,"" commented UPM's CEO, Jussi Pesonen.",Engelska nyheter

After definition and frame work for standard in 2008, during spring 2009 an extensive test program was carried out to confirm that measuring results obtained are highly representative and reliable, as well as independent on equipment or operator bias.”Nordic paper industry has tried to complete a universal paper formation standard already several times during past two decades, but it has always failed because many modern paper grades include a variety of fibre and filler components, coating pigments, and various surface treatments that change paper's optical behaviour and visual appearance independently on basis weight of paper.

This is important to users concerned about sustainability. If they can specify a lighter weight board, provided all criteria regarding stiffness and performance are met, their own carbon footprint will diminish accordingly.The research, commissioned from an external research institute, aimed to produce Life Cycle Assessments for three different weights of board.  Carbon footprints were calculated for 10,000 biscuit cartons produced in 250, 270 and 295 g/m2 weights, to discover if the footprint would reduce proportionately when a lighter weight board was used.Calculations assessed energy used in forestry, transport and manufacturing at all stages from harvesting the wood to making the cartons, including, for example, transporting the board to the customer.Riikka Joukio, Vice President Marketing of M-real Consumer Packaging, says: “By making packaging more effective and less wasteful, sustainability goes hand in hand with cost savings, which can be achieved both by the choice of lightweighted materials and by a design that has the right impact.""“Packaging has a relatively small global warming potential in food products, when compared to other activities taking place in the production of a food product, most notably fertiliser and cultivation.  At the same time, packaging’s importance in reducing food waste, which might otherwise rot down in landfill producing methane – a harmful greenhouse gas – is also well established.  Up to 50 percent of food is wasted in developing countries, where food packaging is less common, compared to western countries, where waste averages two percent and is mostly attributable to over-purchasing.”",Engelska nyheter

The recovery boiler from 2006 has a capacity of 800,000 tons of pulp, and so has the new lime kiln, which will be ready for start-up in November next year.According to Jan Johansson, CEO of SCA, it is, however, not likely that a decision to extend the Östrand mill will be made until after the new lime kiln is up and running.",Engelska nyheter

40342.5677546296,Study shows occupational wellbeing can improve,June 9 2010  A study of the Finnish paper industry indicates that occupational wellbeing can be improved even during substantial structural changes.,"A study by the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health, FIOH, indicates that it is possible to improve occupational wellbeing even during an extensive structural change by focusing on working conditions, strengthening employee competencies as well as teamwork and the training of managers and supervisors. The study was conducted in 2008-2009.Early measures and the hearing out of employee evaluations of their own working ability were among the factors that promoted wellbeing at the workplace. Employees also felt that job rotation made their work more challenging and varied as well as evened out the distribution of the workload. “As job descriptions become ever more expansive, the need to maintain and develop employee competencies is underlined,” says Professor Anneli Leppänen of the FIOH. “More and more employees felt a need to participate in further vocational training. It's positive that effective methods for developing paper manufacturing competence have already been developed and these can be utilised at the workplace after a relatively short familiarisation period.”Finnish Paper Workers' Union President Jouko Ahonen hopes that the findings of the study will be considered in the everyday practices of all paper industry workplaces. “The workload is being shouldered by a smaller number of employees than before because of the structural change. If we want these people to maintain their ability to cope at work and perform to a high standard, we will have to pay more and more attention to occupational wellbeing and working conditions,” Ahonen points out.Executive Vice President Jari Forss of the Finnish Forest Industries Federation highlights the importance of good practices. “The study demonstrated that sickness absences and experiences of occupational wellbeing could be influenced also during substantial structural changes if all involved parties share an appreciation of the matter's importance. The identified best practices should be applied across the entire industry and the most appropriate methods for each individual factory sought out. The continuous improvement of occupational wellbeing and management of sickness absences are also a substantial component in the competitiveness of the industry,” Forss says.",Engelska nyheter

The new method, CCT10, developed by Billerud, subjects the paper to an even, constant load over a period of ten days and in conditions of high humidity.The specification indicates the weight a paper can withstand in these demanding conditions. The test reveals significant differences between the strength and endurance of different qualities - differences that the traditional test does not show as clearly. Billerud Box Lab has the capacity to test boxes and papers using the new CCT10 method. Box Lab has several compression testers and a climate chamber, which can be adjusted for humidity and temperature. It also has the technical competence needed to analyze the results and, when necessary, propose mprovements. Billerud welcomes paper and packaging manufacturers and users of packaging solutions to test their materials in Billerud's Box Lab.

And just recently, Swedish researchers presented a new magnetic nanopaper.","Nanocellulose is a material that is extracted from wood fibres. It has exceptional strength properties, being more or less as strong as Kevlar, a light weight material.“For a long time, there’s been a great deal of interest from industry in utilizing nanocellulose as a strengthening component in other materials, such as paper, composites and plastics,” relates Mikael Ankerfors, Research Manager at  Swedish research company Innventia. “We can also create new, more effective, environmentally compatible and renewable barrier films for packages used for foodstuffs.”Nanocellulose, a super material, is going to have many areas of use in the future. For example, it can be used to make membranes and other reserve parts for the human body.  It can also be used as a provider of viscosity in foodstuffs; in other words, it is able to replace carbohydrates and other additives in foodstuffs, which are known as low calorie products.For the first time, nanocellulose will be able to be produced on a large scale at Innventia in Stockholm, using a new process being economically efficient. Previously, the homogenizing stage in the process was much too demanding, when it comes to energy. Due to the process developments carried out by Innventia, the energy consumption has been reduced by a total of 98 percent.Recently, researchers at the Royal Swedish Institute of Technology, KTH, and the Wallenberg Wood Science Center, WWSC, in Stockholm have succeeded in creating magnetic nanoparticles in super-strong nanopaper. The new nanopaper is extremely light, strong and flexible and can, among other things, be used to prevent the forgery of paper money, and also to filter off metal particles.""Magnetic nanopaper is easy to produce and has unique characteristics, but it also demonstrates the potential product research within multidisciplinary nanotechnology that has for the forest industry,"" says Lars Berglund, head of WWSC and professor of fiber and polymer technology at KTH.Besides the fact that magnetic nanopaper can be used to prevent the falsification of documents, there are other applications of interest, for example for implants in the human body and for small motors and sensors.",Engelska nyheter

No single company would have a majority holding in the new enterprise, as none of the manufacturers want to bear the full burden of the relatively unprofitable newsprint manufacturing business. The first task of the new company would be to shut down the most unprofitable installations, Helsingin Sanomat reports.A joint venture of Stora Enso, Holmen, and Norske Skog would form a concentration on the newsprint market in Europe. The arrangement requires permission from the competition authorities of the European Union. Large newspaper publishers are likely to oppose the plan, as it would lead to a rise in the price of newsprint. On the other hand, competition officials in Brussels are likely to understand that the production of newsprint cannot perpetually involve high production costs and low sales prices.On Thursday morning, trading in the shares of all three companies was suspended. Before the suspension was imposed the value of the Norske Skog stock had risen in Oslo by almost 20 percent. The Holmen A- and B-shares were up more than four and six percent respectively in early trading in Stockholm, and Stora Enso's share price had put on around 4.5 percent as investors responded to the rumours.      In the early afternoon, Stora Enso issued a denial on its website, saying that there are ""no discussions ongoing"" concerning a possible newsprint joint venture between Stora Enso, Holmen, and Norske Skog.

40430.5971296296,World’s first bioDME motor fuels plant inaugurated in Sweden,"Sept 9 2010  Thursday September 9 the world’s first plant for production of the renewable motor fuel BioDME, based on black liquor gasification, was inaugurated in Piteå, northern Sweden.","The plant is built and operated by Chemrec, a Swedish-based technology company, at the company’s development plant located at Smurfit Kappa's kraftliner mill in Piteå.BioDME from forest residues over the Chemrec process reduces net greenhouse gas emissions with about 95 percent, compared to use of petroleum-based diesel oil, the traditional fuel for heavy road transports, according to Chemrec. It also provides excellent engine performance and vehicle drivability. The potential is significant. In Sweden, up to one half of all heavy road transportation could be run on bioDME, and globally well over 30 million cubic meters diesel equivalents per year could be produced from the available black liquor feedstock, enough to fuel one million heavy trucks.“A major step forward for the global biofuels market and an important milestone was achieved today, bringing bioDME closer to commercial deployment, not only for the EU but for the global biofuel market,"" Kyriakos Maniatis, Energy Technologies & Research Co-ordination at DG Energy of the European Commission, said in his inauguration speech. ""This is also a major step forward for the EU strategic energy technology plan, since a unique bioenergy value chain closely linking the pulp and paper industry and bioenergy has been fully deployed for the first time.”This pilot plant is part of the BioDME project where the production of BioDME and its use in heavy trucks is demonstrated.“Since the ground-breaking ceremony for this bioDME plant a year ago, we have made considerable progress. In addition to the building of the plant and getting the Volvo truck test fleet into operation, also the process towards building an industrial scale plant at the Domsjö specialty cellulose mill in Örnsköldsvik, Sweden, has advanced,” said Max Jönsson, CEO of Chemrec. “For the Domsjö project main technology providers have now been selected, and we are ready to start the front-end engineering and design phase.”",Engelska nyheter

40430.6514930556,Money to save for paper industry after research break-through,Sept 9 2010  Swedish research company Innventia has developed a new tachnology that will result in a stronger paper with lower production costs and reduced raw materials consumption.,"The new Aq-Vane technique, developed by Stockholm-based Innventia, is derived from the aircraft industry. It deals with the separation of fiber layers before they are joined together to form the paper. The Aq-Vane technique has the potential to generate increased profits,

based on the form of savings in the fiber raw materials and energy.“This technique uses a thin layer of water to stabilise the fibre layers and consequently form an even flow while they are being joined together. This prevents the layers from blending with each other. This means that it is now possible to keep the layers separate as well as to control the precise properties that are wanted in a paper,” says Daniel Söderberg, Research Manager at Innventia and the person behind the development of the new technology.As of June this year, Innventia is leading BoostEff, an EU project with a total budget of eleven million Euros, to demonstrate the industrial and economical potential of the new method. Using Aq-Vane, with its possibilities for advanced dosage, Innventia, in collaboration with Stora Enso is developing the kind of paper that is used in catalogues and magazines.

“For a paper mill that produces 450,000 tons of the new paper per

year, this technology means an annual savings of approximately 120

million Kronor,” says Daniel Söderberg.For a product such as the Ikea catalogue, of which approximately 200 million copies are distributed each year, this means enormous savings. For the papermaking industry as a whole, this implies a savings in billions of Kronor, Innventia writes in a press release.Daniel Söderberg explains: “We’ve tailor-made a new kind of uncoated paper, which is the same type as that used in the Ikea catalogues. By putting finer fibers in the surface and coarse fibers in the middle of the paper we’re able to save up to ten percent in costs on fiber raw materials and energy.”",Engelska nyheter

40442.4868865741,Wood costs for pulp mills in Sweden on the rise,"Sept 21 2010  Average softwood and hardwood pulplogs costs in Sweden have gone up twelve percent and 18 percent (in US Dollar terms), respectively, in twelve months. In Swedish Kronor the increases have been slightly smaller.","Despite slower lumber export sales, sawlog prices in Sweden continued upward in the second quarter of 2010, reaching their highest levels on record in localcurrency. Log prices have increased faster in the southern part of the country, where both sawlogs and pulpwood prices are now higher than in the northern region. As a result, forest owners in Central and Northern Sweden are increasingly considering shipping logs southbound, unless local log prices become more attractive, according to the Wood Resource Quarterly.Swedish sawmills continue to have lower wood costs than many of their competitors in Finland, Germany and Austria, as reported in the Wood Resource Quarterly. However, the cost discrepancy has declined substantially from last year. Sawmills in Eastern Europe and Northwest Russia, on the other hand, currently have 15-30 percent lower wood costs than Swedish mills with the Czech Republic being the only exception.Pulpwood costs, which account for about 60 percent of cash costs for Swedish pulp mills, were higher in the second quarter this year as compared to the same quarter last year. Average softwood and hardwood pulplogs costs have gone up twelve percent and 18 percent (in US Dollar terms), respectively, in twelve months, according to the Wood Resource Quarterly. In the local currency, the increases have been slightly smaller.With many sawmills reducing production this summer and fall and as a result, less availability of residual chips, the demand for pulplogs has increased. The pulp industry is very dependent on wood chips as this source is typically the lowest cost fiber. In 2009, just over 27 percent of the total softwood fiber consumption was bi-products from Sweden’s sawmills. It is likely that this share will be slightly lower this year because of the continued high demand for fiber and a reduction in available supply of residual chips.As a result, there will continue to be strong demand for pulplogs in the coming months.",Engelska nyheter

The event took place in Munich in late September. The Summit discussed challenges for the paper industry.,"""Paper – The King of Media"", which was the theme of the Summit, which noted that the economic upheaval provides opportunities for the paper industry. The global paper market has managed to recover after the decline of 2009 and is now returning to the levels of previous average years. On the profit side, however, it is a completely different story. The prices of some raw materials have multiplied greatly in recent years, but the price of paper is currently at the same level as it was in the 80s. This will need to be adjusted, the Summit concluded.Hanna Pihkola from the VTT Techni¬cal Research Centre of Finland headed the line-up of international speakers. She spoke about the ecological equilibrium in the print media and disproved the general opinion that print is environmentally suboptimal. One example: the production of a single magazine produces the same amount of CO2 as a 1.5-kilometer car journey.Jacek Utko from Bonnier Business Press demonstrated clearly in his talk “How design can save print media” that these days’ print products will only be successful, if they conform to the formula of strategy content design, but also that business models are ultimately what count, not the product.

40465.557025463,Reduced workforce at Holmen Paper Madrid,Oct 14 2010  29 people will be made redundant at Holmen Paper’s mill in Madrid as part of an ongoing efficiency drive. This drive also includes looking into alternative options for PM61.,"The smaller of the mill’s two paper machines, PM61, is operating at a loss and has done so for some time, despite active improvement measures. These have included switching from production of newsprint to production of coated printing paper, LWC, based on 100 percent recovered fiber. Since September employees have been temporarily laid off due to the shortage of recovered paper. The workforce reduction now being announced is part of a wider review of costs.“The market situation for printing paper continues to be tough. The shortage of recovered fiber and the resulting cost increase means that in parallel to workforce reduction, we’re looking into different courses of action for PM61. One possible path is to switch to other product areas, which can be achieved in partnership or in their entirety by another player,” comments Arne Wallin, head of Holmen Paper.The staff cuts will be made with immediate effect and affect 29 people, of which seven work in production and 22 have administrative duties. The cuts will take place in parallel with a new organization entering into force.

40469.6091782407,"Biofuels not emission-free, new method for impact assessment states",October 18 2010  Finnish researcher and climate change expert Johanna Kirkinen presents a new approach to life cycle calculations of biofuels for assessing their greenhouse impacts. Forest residues has the smallest climate impact but still heat the atmosphere more than the energy produced.,"In her thesis work at VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, Johanna Kirkinen has studied the impacts on climate change of various biomass-based fuels used in Finland. The impact of forest residues proved to be the least important.Combating climate change requires a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Biomass-based fuels are considered to be a means of achieving these emission reductions. However, biofuels are not carbon-neutral or emission-free, as is often believed. They cause an effect that heats the atmosphere when the entire life cycle of the fuel’s production and use is taken into consideration.The greenhouse gas impacts and possible emission reductions of the fuels must, therefore, be proven clearly and comprehensively, according to Johanna Kirkinen.In her thesis work, Kirkinen studied the greenhouse impacts of the following fuel chains: forest residues, reed canary grass, coal, natural gas, and peat. Forest residues has the smallest climate impact, but they still heat the atmosphere by 20–40 times compared to the amount of energy they produce. Reed canary grass has a slightly greater impact than forest residues (climate impact between 20 and 50). Natural gas heats the atmosphere 100–110 times and coal 170–190 times the amount of energy they produce.If one wishes to limit global warming to 2–3 degrees, the consideration of time spans in the assessment of greenhouse impacts is emphasised, as emissions must be drastically reduced as early as during the next couple of decades. The timing of the greenhouse effect will thus be a very important factor when considering the sustainability of biofuels, according to Johanna Kirkinen.",Engelska nyheter

40470.3979976852,Statement of principles catalyst for Tasmanian pulp mill project,"Oct 19 2010  Australian forest company Gunns Ltd, which is planning to build a new giant pulp mill on the Australian island of Tasmania, possibly in collaboration with Swedish Södra, welcomes a historic forest statement of principles, which was announced yesterday.","The statement is intended to end the long-running conflict between the industry and environmental groups by implementing an immediate moratorium on logging high conservation value forests. The principles set out a framework to reach an agreement that would eventually end native forest logging in Tasmania and transition to a plantation-based industry. Gunns’ CEO, Greg L’Estrange, told Australian media yesterday that the agreement is a momentous step and is aligned with Gunns’ existing strategy of moving towards becoming a fully plantation-based company. The statement also recognizes the importance of a pulp mill as part of the creation of a strong, sustainable, plantation timber industry.“These principles will lead to certainty for the environment and certainty for continued jobs, with the acknowledgment that the construction of a pulp mill and the jobs it will create is critical to the transition to a plantation-based industry,” Greg L’Estrange said. “A plantation-based industry is fundamental for the future of the forest industry in Tasmania, and an important part of that modern industry is the Bell Bay pulp mill,” he said. It is known, as Papernet earlier has reported, that one condition for Södra’s involvement in the Bell Bay pulp mill project is that the mill will be supplied with 100 percent plantation-grown wood. Another condition is TCF bleaching (total chlorine free bleaching).The planned pulp mill will have a capacity of approximately 1.1 million tons per year.",Engelska nyheter

Chinese fir sawlogs prices were almost 17 percent higher in the 2Q/10 as compared to the same quarter in 2009, according to the Wood Resource Quarterly. Eucalyptus logs, mainly used by the pulp industry, have also become more expensive the past twelve months, reaching new record-highs.The continued high costs of locally sourced logs has resulted in higher volumes being imported so far this year. During the first eight months of 2010, the total imports of softwood and hardwood logs were up 23 percent compared to the same period in 2009. After Russia introduced its log export tax of 25 percent of the log value in 2008, shipments to China fell from a record 25 million cubic meters in 2007 to less than 15 million this year.During the first eight months of this year, imports of wood chips to China have more than doubled, compared to last year, as reported in the Wood Resource Quarterly. Pulp mills in China have increased their consumption of imported wood fiber dramatically in just two years. The total chip imports for 2010 are likely to be close to five times as much as in 2008.

This has resulted in lower bearing replacement costs.","For SCA Ortviken, SPM HD measuring technique is the solution to years of problems with bearing related breakdowns on the twin wire presses, used for dewatering of the pulp. None of the monitoring systems installed in the mill provided a dependable method for detection of bearing wear and damage, and bearing replacements therefore were carried out in conjunction with timebased maintenance.The lack of reliable bearing condition information often lead to the dismounting of the wrong bearings, in turn causing breakdowns on other bearings in worse condition.Then in the summer this year, the Intellinova online system with SPM HD was installed on Ortviken’s four Andritz twin wire presses. Following a short period of system calibration, six bearing damages have been successfully identified to date. Four bearings have been replaced during planned stops and two more will be replaced in the near future. Examination of the replaced bearings have verified that the system does indicate the correct type of bearing damage, and bearing replacement costs are now significantly reduced.",Engelska nyheter

40507.4759375,SCA appeals against lifting of duty on Australian tissue imports,Nov 25 2010  SCA and Kimberly-Clark have appealed against a decision in Australia to lift anti-dumping duties on imports of Chinese and Indonesian toilet paper.,"The two tissue giants recently argued before the Federal Court of Australia that the attorney general's decision to revoke the 2009 interim dumping duties should not be allowed.The legal basis of their case is that the Australian Customs Act does not allow for the re-investigation that the attorney general ordered, and on which he based the decision to revoke the duties, Tissue News reports.Paul Thompson, president of SCA Hygiene Australasia, explained that a decision on the case is expected during the first quarter of next year, but would not comment further while it was still before the courts.The case started in December 2008, when the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service ruled in favor of Kimberly-Clark’s and SCA’s claim that imports of premium-grade toilet tissue from China and Indonesia undercut prices and caused material injury to the Australian industry, starting from 2007. As a result, the anti-dumping duties were raised from two to 45 percent on such imports.The measures were to remain in place for five years, but the country's attorney general ordered the reinvestigation of the case, following appeals by several bodies, including two of APP's subsidiaries Gold Hongye Paper of China and Pindo Deli Pulp and Paper Mills of Indonesia, and the Indonesian government.Following the reinvestigation, it was confirmed that Chinese and Indonesian toilet paper imports were dumped in the Australian market and had caused injury to the domestic industry.

It was, according to Johan Freij and Roger Josefsson, forest industry analysts at Danske Bank, the Swedish forest industry – saw mills and pulp and paper industry – that in combination with a weak Swedish Krona saved the country.Forest based business accounts for around ten percent of Sweden’s export, but considering imports to Swedish industries, the picture is different. Looking at the net export value, the Swedish forest industry accounts for between 50 and 75 percent.The reason is that the forest industry, in contrast to all other Swedish export industries, has a very small import of goods.Following the financial crisis in the world the forest industry’s share of the Swedish net export value exploded and even passed 100 percent.Danske Bank’s Freij and Josefsson describe how that can be possible. The fact that many other Swedish industries occasionally had a higher import value than export value during the crisis affected the total net export negatively.When the currency weakens, as the Swedish Krona during the financial crisis, the export is affected positively, while imports of goods become more expensive.The conclusion is that the forest industry, supported by a weak Swedish currency, saved the growth in Swedish economy during the financial crisis, according to Johan Freij and Roger Josefsson, Danske Bank.",Engelska nyheter

It includes key trends and technical developments for 38 end-use applications.Specialty paper markets tend to be niche segments that have the potential for higher average margins than commodity markets, and have fairly stable pricing over time. They are also defined as markets for products that are made in smaller quantities, with their rarity or greater difficulty in manufacture allowing a premium price. The Pira study covers specialties in the following segments: décor, flexible packaging, printing, filtration, electrical, security and ‘others’.According to the study, there are signs of continued saturation and stagnation in Western Europe, Japan and the US. In some developed markets such as Spain and the UK some serious falls in tonnage have been evident. Pira predicts continued expansion of the Chinese, Indian, Russian and Brazilian economies as well as in Turkey and Poland.""Per capita consumption of most specialty papers is relatively low in each of these major emerging markets and as their needs develop, there is no reason to doubt that their economies will absorb more of the specialty papers, which facilitate commerce and industry in the developed world,"" explains Adam Page, Head of Editorial at Pira.",Engelska nyheter

Hardwood duties will be reduced by three-thirds and softwood duties by half.For the forest industry in Finland, which is the country in the Nordic region that has been hit hardest by the Russian export duties on wood, it would have been necessary to implement lower duties much sooner than the the time for Russia's WTO membership, which can be realized in about a year, according to the Finnish Forest Industries Federation.“It would have been good if the lower duties, which were agreed to in negotiations between the EU and Russia last November, could have taken effect immediately at the beginning of 2011 instead of after about a year, because this would have promoted the revival of our forest industry cooperation,"" says Timo Jaatinen, Director General of the Finnish Forest Industries Federation.""Russia has considered forest industry investments important, but these cannot be implemented if export duties and other trade barriers that hamper activities are not removed as quickly as possible. Russia should also focus on the development of its infrastructure and boost confidence in the availability of wood raw material for decades to come,” Jaatinen adds.Timber export duties will not be removed in their entirety once Russia joins the WTO, but the expectation is that they will not target the timber grades, which are imported by Finland, as heavily as has been the case up to now. The duties levied on hardwood will reduce by about three-thirds and softwood duties will be cut by about half.The forest industry of Finland has adjusted its operations to reduced Russian timber imports and largely relies on domestic raw materials.

Any modernization of forest management practices must ensure the good growth and availability of timber also in the future, according to the Forest Industries Federation.The majority of forest owners value the profitability of forestry. This is why they favour prevailing forest management methods, which produce a lot of wood for markets and processing. Owners also use different methods to reconcile the commercial utilisation of forests with other values in different parts of their forest estates. For some owners, the yield of a forest is not the most central object – not in all parts of their forest holdings, at least. Alternative, researched methods, which also result in the production of wood for processing, are needed for such forest owners, the Federation writes in its statement.However, the introduction of new forest management methods must not lead to the proliferation of low-yielding forests.

This reduction in profit compared with 64 million for the third quarter was, according to Rottneros CEO, Ole Terland, primarily due to the planned shutdown of production at Vallvik mill and the strengthening of the Swedish Krona.

40577.4436111111,CEPI: Focus on industrial raw materials must be kept clear,"Feb 3 2011  The European paper industry welcomes the European Commission’s communication on raw materials, adopted February 2, CEPI, the Confederation of European Paper Industries, writes in perss a statement.","Concrete actions are needed to address the increasingly critical supply of raw materials to European industries. This includes the raw materials of the European paper industry: The push for renewable energies calls for a biomass supply policy across Europe, taking the use of wood as raw material as a priority, CEPI writes. The massive exports of recovered paper collected in Europe to east Asian markets is a second reason why raw material policy is needed. The Commission communication addresses both issues.However, CEPI points out that EU has to keep a clear focus while addressing intrinsically different markets of raw materials, energy and agricultural commodities.The European pulp and paper industry’s raw material base is in Europe. Because of their renewable nature they are much sought-after. A strategy for the sustainable supply of wood and biomass is therefore needed, including concrete measures for raw materials mobilisation from European primary and secondary sources. The promotion of the resource hierarchy principle, whereby raw materials are used first to deliver added value in products, would bring consistency in EU policies, according to CEPI.“Facilitating access to raw materials that end up in subsidy-based, unsustainable business models does not make sense,” said Teresa Presas, CEPI’s Managing Director. “Instead, the priority access should be for industries that use the resources efficiently and contribute to the EU 2020 competitiveness and climate change goals.”",Engelska nyheter

Sensible climate policies should encourage increasing forest growth and wood utilization, the report states.","A recent report published by the Finnish Environment Institute examines the climate impacts of using wood to generate energy. Bioenergy can replace fossil fuels, which are more harmful for the climate, the report concludes.When wood is burned to generate energy, the carbon dioxide is released back into the atmosphere a little faster than if the wood was left to rot in the forest. However, a slight speed-up to the natural carbon cycle is better than using fossil fuels, according to the Finnish report. Fossil fuels release carbon that has not been in the atmosphere over hundreds of millions of years. Burning fossil fuels leads to an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide content and global warming. Producing renewable energy by burning forest residue is sustainable from the climate and environment perspectives, because the released carbon is rebound by growing forests.Processable wood should not, however, be burned to generate energy, if it can be used in carbon-storing products, the Finnish Forest Industries Federation writes in a press release. Forest energy should be produced from wood that is unsuitable for use as product raw material and would otherwise be left to rot in the forest. Increased utilization of wood for products also brings more forest residue available for energy use, according to the Federation.",Engelska nyheter

	","Erik Næsset has created a tool to portray spatially the forest inventory

parameters of interest. He invented a straightforward and practical

method for utilizing airborne laser scanning in combination with forest

field data which automatically produces stand-wise forest data with

high accuracy. The area based method of airborne laser scanning that he

has developed has become a reference against which new inventory

methods are compared.Laser scanning is now a commercially used

practice, making a considerable difference in how forests are

inventoried throughout the world. Cost reductions of typically 40-50 prcent

for forest management inventories have been recorded. Of great

significance is the value of the statistical and economic efficiency

improvements in forest management inventories. The airborne laser

scanning technique is also useful in assessment of many other forest

ecosystem services.Professor Næsset was appointed Professor in 1996.

Since 1997 he has been Professor at the Department for Ecology and

Action plans should be long-term in nature, but their implementation must commence without delay, the organizations claim. Privately owned forests supply about 80 percent of the industry’s wood consumption.MTK and the Finnish Forest Industries Federation present as their shared view that a National Wood Construction Program should be launched; that the competitiveness of forestry and the forest industry should be promoted through long-term tax incentives and facilitate the functioning of the timber market with corresponding measures. Taxation should be used to improve the ownership structure of forests by facilitating generational transfers, preventing the fragmentation of forest holdings and promoting the market entry of forest estates. Furthermore, the two organizations want to improve the operating environment for forestry entrepreneurship and  improve the functionality of the forestry services market.According to MTK and FFIF, the government should implement the renewable energy target program, taking into consideration the forest industry’s role as a producer of renewable energy and making sure that enough raw materials remain available for the industry.MTK and FFIF also ask the government to enhance the efficiency of wood procurement logistics by developing the railway terminal network, fixing up the lower road network and by raising the maximum permitted total weight of timber transport lorries.",Engelska nyheter

The new knowledge in this area contributes to making existing paper industry processes more efficient and to develop new materials from biopolymers.,"Jasna Stevanic Srndovic’s thesis present results that provide a better understanding of polymer interactions within the primary cell wall of spruce wood fibers and its implications for the energy demand in the refining process. She demonstrates how applying a low degree of sulphonation pre-treatment to spruce wood chips caused a weakening of these molecular interactions, as well as an increased softening and swelling of the material, thereby reducing the energy consumption within the refining process.Large quantities of polymers, such as cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin, recovered from residual materials from the paper industry and agriculture, can be used to produce new renewable packaging materials. In her work, Jasna Stevanic Srndovic has investigated the ultra structure of the secondary cell wall of spruce wood fibers, and has tried to imitate the structures found in wood fibers by preparing bio composites and evaluating these as packaging materials.“Nature’s unique material structures have many excellent qualities,” she explains. “For example, they can withstand variations in climatic conditions. By attempting to imitate these synthetically, it may be possible to develop new bio-based materials with adapted qualities. I’ve produced hemicellulose films with improved mechanical properties by strengthening these with nanocellulose.” “Increased knowledge regarding the interactions between the wood polymers is very important in order to be able to separate these in a better way, for use in new materials and other applications,” says Lennart Salmén, head of the Fiber and Material Science group at Innventia.",Engelska nyheter

The worldwide financial crisis that unfolded in 2008 hit European printers hard, and the industry is not expected to recover its former volume.VTT has studied the present situation of the European printing industry and explored means for future survival by interviewing more than 30 representatives at 18 European enterprises in the field.The study shows that in order to survive, the European printing industry must either increase production efficiency and flexibility, increase the value of printed products or launch new applications and services exploiting printing competence. These are the ways in which the industry can survive in a situation where print runs are shrinking but the range of printed products is expanding.Production efficiency may mean, for example, that printing presses support a wider range of formats and products more flexibly than before. Hybrid printed products, combining digital and traditional printing, are a case in point.",Engelska nyheter

Stockholm by publishing the pilot study results for paper’s water footprint in

cooperation with the Water Footprint Network.","A Water Footprint Assessment maps the amount of freshwater consumed throughout the production chain of paper. The results show that water for growing trees represents the primary contribution to the total water footprint of paper.“If you think about the water needed in producing one sheet of A4, most of the water is used in the forest as part of the natural water cycle,” says Sami Lundgren, Director, Environmental Services, UPM.“By working with the Water Footprint Network, UPM has taken a leading role in reviewing sustainable water use in the paper industry. The Water Footprint Network applauds this initiative. UPM’s pilot study shows that when forests are managed sustainably, paper products will have little contribution to the growing concerns of water scarcity,” explains Ruth Mathews, Executive Director, Water Footprint Network.Water footprint divides the water into three different types – green, blue and grey. Green water represents the natural water cycle – the water evaporated by trees. Blue water refers to water withdrawn from rivers, lakes and aquifers. Grey water presents the amount of water needed to assimilate the remaining pollutants after cleaning process wastewater.“According to our pilot study, 60% of paper’s water footprint is green water,1% is blue water and 39% grey water. Around 99% of the water footprint comes from the supply chain and the remaining 1% from the actual paper mill production processes,” explains Sami Lundgren.The efficient use of water is a key area of environmental responsibility in UPM. UPM’s waste water volume per tonne of paper produced is nearly half of what it was 15 years ago. In 2010 UPM set a long term environmental target for 2020 to further reduce the quantity and improve the quality of waste water in pulp and paper production. In addition to paper’s water footprint development, UPM has started a water footprint study for the production of plywood in Finland./KB",Engelska nyheter

40786.3655324074,UPM to reduce 1.3 million tonnes of paper capacity in Europe,"Aug 31, 2011 As part of the Myllykoski integration, UPM has

completed a comprehensive review of the long term competitiveness of its

publication paper mills. The review has covered asset efficiency, production

input availability and costs as well as end-use markets. As a result of the

review, UPM plans to adjust its magazine paper capacity to match the needs of

its global customer base. Therefore, UPM will start negotiations with employees

on the plan to permanently remove 1.2 million tonnes of magazine paper capacity

in Finland, Germany and France, and 110,000 of newsprint capacity in Germany.

The plan also includes restructuring of the overlapping paper sales and supply

chain networks and global functions.","The planned measures include permanent closure of the UPM Myllykoski mill in Kouvola in Finland, the UPM Albbruck mill in Germany, paper machine 3  at the UPM Ettringen mill in Germany and transfer of the sheeting lines from UPM Albbruck mill to UPM Plattling mill in Germany. The measures also include sale or other exit of the UPM Stracel paper mill from UPM Paper Business Group and restructuring of overlapping paper sales and supply chain network as well as global functions.In addition, UPM plans to temporarily close the paper machine 2 producing uncoated fine paper at UPM Nordland Papier in Germany and streamline operations in Pietarsaari pulp and paper mills in Finland.The planned closure of the Myllykoski and Albbruck mills and the paper machine 3 of UPM Ettringen would be scheduled by the end of 2011. The Stracel mill sales process would start this autumn and is expected to be completed within twelve months.The implementation of the plan would reduce the number of employees by approximately 1,170. Based on the plan, UPM will book in the third quarter of 2011 an approximately EUR 70 million write-off in fixed assets and make a provision for costs of approximately EUR 200 million. Net cash impact from the restructuring plan amounts to approximately EUR 170 million. Annual synergy benefits of the Myllykoski acquisition including the planned actions are estimated to total approximately EUR 200 million.“The paper industry faces severe challenges due to high raw material, energy and logistics costs, and considerable overcapacity. The profitability of our paper business is clearly below the level required to run long-term sustainable operations. The planned restructuring would further strengthen the cost competitiveness of UPM’s paper operations and reduce the future need for major maintenance investments”, says UPM’s President and CEO Jussi Pesonen.“With the planned actions we would respond to the magazine paper overcapacity challenge for our own benefit. In addition, we would ensure the efficient use of our remaining capacity. However, this plan would not solve the cost challenges of the industry,” says Pesonen.“Our aim is to improve the profitability and cost competitiveness of our magazine papers. The planned measures would immediately reduce the unit costs of UPM’s magazine papers and newsprint from the level before the acquisition of Myllykoski.  In spite of the restructuring, we would be able to serve our paper customers better through our improved product portfolio and geographic scope”, says Jyrki Ovaska, President of UPM Paper Business Group.“The planned closures are very unfortunate for the affected employees but restructuring is the only way to make a fundamental improvement in the cost competitiveness of our paper business. UPM will carry out the restructuring negotiations in a responsible and professional manner in line with the national legislation of the respective countries,” says Ovaska.UPM will consider options to establish a “From-job-to-job” programme appropriate to the local legislation provided the plan proceeds to implementation.  The planned actions will be discussed in the upcoming negotiations with employees and authorities./KB",Engelska nyheter

As a result, it brings together all pertinent information in a manner that is easy to understand. The outcome of the analysis is valuable for example for measuring environmental sustainability, as a benchmarking or due diligence tool, or as a means of pinpointing weak areas that need performance improvements.""In many companies sustainability is connected to the company principles and needs to be communicated to various stakeholders. Currently there are no standards available that put all the relevant factors together in a way that gives a comprehensive overview. The Green Mill Index was developed to fill this need"", comments Päivi Käki, technology specialist at Pöyry.""Thinking green is not only good for the environment"", she reminds, ""but it can also provide improvements in efficiency that have a direct impact on the bottom line. By seeing the full picture, you can understand what areas to target.""Many of the indicators used in Pöyry's Green Mill Index are based on European Commission standards for best available technology, known as BAT levels. For example, the Green Mill indicators for emissions and efficiency refer to the BAT levels. Other indicators are based on actual statistical data collected from several mills.",Engelska nyheter

participating in a feasibility study with energy companies Gasum and Helsingin

Energia into constructing a biorefinery for biogas production in Joutseno,

southeastern Finland. If realised, the biorefinery would produce biogas from

renewable wood raw material for transmission to usage sites such as Helsinki

Energy’s Vuosaari power plant via the Finnish natural gas network.","According to the preliminary plan, Metsä-Botnia and its parent company Metsäliitto would be responsible for wood raw material procurement and biorefinery operation. The plan is to mainly produce biogas from forest chips and bark, both of which are available as by-products of pulp mill wood procurement. The production capacity of the planned refinery would be as high as 200 MW.? “Joutseno is a logistically excellent location for a biorefinery that produces biogas. The raw material supply chain is already in place and our pulp mill is already connected to the natural gas transmission network,” says Ilkka Hämälä, President and CEO of Metsä-Botnia.?The planned biorefinery would gasify wood chips and refine them into at least 95% methane. The composition of the end product would therefore correspond to that of natural gas. According to the plan, Gasum would take care of biogas injection into the gas network and distribution to gas users.?The companies are launching a feasibility study into the technical concept and business operating model of the biorefinery. The aim is to complete the information required for a possible investment decision by 2013. The construction of the refinery will take two to three years from the go-ahead decision.? If implemented, the project would contribute to the utilisation of forest raw material in Finland: biogas would be produced from local wood raw material in the biorefinery and transmitted along the Finnish gas network.

months amounted to 879 million Kronor (1,994 million for the same

period last year).“The market is being affected by the uncertainty caused by the effects of the debt crisis in Europe and the USA. At the other end of the scale, we have globally high timber costs as a balancing factor. In addition, demand in Asia, and in particular in China, remains strong,” said Leif Brodén, Södra’s CEO.“How quickly the uncertainty will reverse and the markets bottom out and head back up again, will be determined mainly by how the politicians continue to handle the debt crisis,” added Brodén.The pulp market was characterized by prices that remained buoyant, compared with historical levels. Lower prices in Dollars over the period was compensated for by a stronger Dollar against the Krona. The accumulated average price over the first three quarters of the year amounted to 983 Dollars per ton for bleached softwood sulphate pulp and 853 Dollars per ton for hardwood pulp.Producers’ stocks of pulp increased over the quarter, with levels of short fiber pulp seeing the biggest increase. European customers’ stocks of purchased pulp remained at historically low levels.Södra's deliveries of pulp amounted to 1,374,000 tons (1,518,000).

Cash flow from operating activities amounted to 531 million Kronor, which is very strong,” said Per Lindberg, CEO of Billerud. ”Operating profit for the quarter of 296 million Kronor means that earnings for the third quarter were just as strong as in the previous quarters in 2011,” Lindberg said.For the first nine mionths of the year Billerud’s net sales were 7,257 million Kronor (6,549).

40847.4522106481,Poor result in Newsprint business for Mondi   ,"Oct 31, 2001 Mondi Group’s underlying operating profit in

the third quarter 2011 of €136 million (year to date €490 million) was well

above that of the comparable prior year period but below that achieved in the

previous quarter (€175 million). This performance reflects the impact of the

planned third quarter maintenance shuts, estimated to have negatively affected

underlying operating profit by approximately €20 million, and a generally

softer trading environment, including the impact of destocking, compared to a

very strong first half of 2011.","During the quarter, the uncertainties inherent in the macroeconomic environment resulted in some weakening in demand and moderately lower sales prices. This was partly offset by stable or reducing input costs. Average benchmark recovered fibre prices were down by 4% in the quarter, whilst wood costs remained largely unchanged over the same period.Most emerging market currencies to which the Group is exposed as a net exporter were slightly weaker against the euro when compared to the second quarter, providing a small positive contribution to the Group’s performance. Similarly, the recent strengthening of the US dollar versus the euro is offering some support to European pricing.The Uncoated Fine Paper (UFP) business continued to perform very strongly. Underlying operating profit was in line with that of the comparable period of the prior year, but below that of the previous quarter. Sales volumes were lower than the previous quarter due to the expected seasonal summer slowdown and the impact of planned annual maintenance shuts. Maintenance shuts were carried out at all three of the Group’s large mills during the quarter. Average selling prices were marginally down on the previous quarter on currency and mix effects.In the Corrugated business, underlying operating profit was well above the comparable prior year period, but below that of the second quarter due to the planned maintenance shuts at Swiecie and Syktyvkar, lower average paper selling prices and reduced income from green energy credits (around €10 million reduction versus the second quarter). Selling prices for the virgin containerboard products were flat to marginally down in the quarter. Recycled containerboard prices were down by around 5% on a combination of currency and mix effects and input cost declines. Sales volumes were marginally higher than those achieved in the first two quarters of the year. Recovered fibre input costs reduced during the period, most notably towards the end of the quarter, with benchmark recovered fibre prices down by around 4% between 30 June 2011 and 30 September 2011. Wood costs have remained largely constant when compared to the second quarter of 2011.The Newsprint business continues to deliver poor results. The South African business, Mondi Shanduka Newsprint, continues to be impacted by a rising cost base, largely due to a series of significant electricity price increases. Management is actively assessing various options to address the resultant unacceptable financial performance. The very weak European newsprint market continues to impact on Aylesford Newsprint’s ability to return to profitability./KB",Engelska nyheter

Statutory negotiations related to the possible closure of the paper production and the development of sheeting capacity covering the whole of Äänekoski paper and board mills’ personnel of approximately 370 people will be commenced on 9 November. Amount of personnel at the Äänekoski mills is expected to reduce by 180 at the maximum.   Currently there is one machine at Äänekoski paper mill with an annual capacity of approximately 200,000 tons of coated fine paper. After the planned closure of paper production the paper and board sheeting operations at the site are planned to be combined. This would increase the folding boxboard sheeting capacity and improve M-real’s profitability.M-real’s coated papers will also in the future be sold by Sappi Fine Paper Europe. Based on the planned measures M-real’s annual coated paper capacity would reduce by approximately 145,000 tons.

April 2012.","Metsä Tissue has carefully analysed three alternative options for the future use of the Konstancin-Jeziorna site, which were initially communicated in May 2010. The three alternatives were to use the site for warehousing and converting, to use it solely for warehousing, or to rezone it for residential development. Today the company has confirmed that all production at the site will be closed in April 2012 and the two latter options are to be studied further.“As our Polish and other Eastern and Central European customers can be served by our other mills in Poland, Slovakia, Germany and the Nordic countries, after weighing our options, this decision – though not easy – was the only sensible course of action. The closure will affect up to 140 employees,” says Hannu Kottonen, CEO of Metsä Tissue. The company will immediately initiate a consultation procedure with the Polish employee representatives.“We made this decision to close our operations in Konstancin-Jeziorna also due to the obsolete infrastructure, which would have required significant short- and long-term investment and would have been unsustainable for the company,” comments Lars Warvne, SVP, Technology and Operations, Metsä Tissue.Since the initial announcement in May 2010 and during the evaluation of the three options, Metsä Tissue has been working intensively with local authorities to find sustainable solutions to offset the impact of the closure on the community infrastructure. Metsä Tissue has been discussing the option of rezoning the site for alternative uses with local authorities. The rezoning option could support the city’s development as an attractive residential area close to Warsaw. At this stage, the company wants to keep alternative uses of the site open.As part of Metsä Tissue’s development programme announced in May 2010, the company will invest in upgrading its Krapkowice mill in southern Poland to increase production capacity and to enhance the brand, product and service offering.

In 2011, record volumes are being imported mainly from hardwood plantations in Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia. Imported wood chip costs from Vietnam have gone up 40 percent in two years and are closing in on costs for chips shipped to Japan, according to the Wood Resource Quarterly.With the lack of sufficient quality and quantity of domestic wood fiber supply, new pulp mills in China are looking to expand importation of wood chips from plantation-rich countries in Southeast Asia to meet their growing fiber needs. In the third quarter of 2011, Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia were the major suppliers to China, together accounting for about 88 percent of all imports of hardwood chips, as reported in the Wood Resource Quarterly.Malaysia, Cambodia, Chile and Brazil are few of the recent and still small suppliers of hardwood chips to China. These countries, which all supply wood chips from fast-growing Eucalyptus and Acacia plantations, are likely to expand their shipments in the coming years when Chinese pulp mills continue to diversify their supply sources.    The wood chip imports in the first ten months of 2011 already equal more than the total volume of imports in all of 2010. This year’s imports will reach around seven million tons, or 37 percent higher than in 2010. This upward trend is expected to continue in 2012 and 2013 because the Chinese pulp industry is in an expansion mode.   Pulpmills in China consume practically only hardwood fiber, so imports of softwood chips were negligible up until last year when a few shipments started to enter Chinese ports from Australia, Russia, the US and New Zealand. This year, total softwood imports may reach just above 300,000 tons, or four percent of total chip imports. /AA",Engelska nyheter

UPM will implement a social plan in order to alleviate the effects caused by personnel reductions in a responsible way,” says Hartmut Wurster, Executive Vice President, who represented UPM during the round table discussions.The sheeting lines of the mill will be transferred to the company’s paper mill in Plattling in order to complement UPM’s product portfolio. “UPM sees the coated mechanical sheets as solid business, and is committed to serve the customers after the Albbruck closure smoothly and promptly,” explains Jyrki Ovaska. Approximately 30 new positions will be created through this measure and applications from Albbruck specialists will be prioritized.The Albbruck decision finalizes the paper capacity closure plans that were announced by UPM last August. UPM Albbruck paper mill had a capacity of 320,000 tons of magazine papers.

But what we don’t need is political broadsides below the waterline,” says Ulf Larsson, President of SCA Forest Products, in an interview published on SCA's web page.“We have large and competitive production facilities, and we have access to a fantastic fiber raw material,” Ulf Larsson answers a question how he rates the competitiveness of SCA Forest Product’s industrial facilities.”Forward-thinking energy investments have enabled us to internally build up a cost-efficient energy supply system that has significantly contributed to the competitiveness of the plants. The mills in Aylesford and Laakirchen are attractively located close to the markets in the UK and central Europe, whereas the mills in Sweden are close to the raw material,” Larsson says.But Ulf Larsson is disappointed with the current Swedish government: “The politicians come along with one deathblow to the industry after another, in the form of short-term or non-existent energy policies and sulphur restrictions on marine fuel, which are disastrous for the competitiveness of Swedish industry and, in practice, increase environmentally harmful emissions.””As a result of these restrictions, it will be cheaper to transport pulp from South America to Europe than from Scandinavia, thus undermining our competitiveness,” Larsson adds.",Engelska nyheter
40932.0253009259,VTT and Aalto University develop packing material from fibril pulp,"Jan 23 2012  VTT Technical Research Center and Aalto University in Helsinki have developed a method, which for the first time enables manufacturing of a wood-based and plastic-like material in large scale.","The method developed by VTT and Aalto University enables industrial scale roll-to-roll production of nanofibrillated cellulose film, which is suitable for example for food packaging to protect products from spoilage.Nanofibrillated cellulose typically binds high amounts of water and forms gels with only a few percent dry matter content. This characteristic has been a bottleneck for industrial-scale manufacture. In most cases, fibril cellulose films are manufactured through pressurized filtering, but the gel-like nature of the material makes this route difficult. In addition, the wires and membranes used for filtering may leave a so-called “mark” on the film, which has a negative impact on the evenness of the surface.According to the method developed by VTT and Aalto University nanofibrillated cellulose films are manufactured by evenly coating fibril cellulose on plastic films so that the spreading and adhesion on the surface of the plastic can be controlled. The films are dried in a controlled manner by using a range of existing techniques. Thanks to the management of spreading, adhesion and drying, the films do not shrink and are completely even. The more fibrillated cellulose material is used, the more transparent films can be manufactured.Several meters of fibril cellulose film have been manufactured with VTT’s pilot-scale device in Espoo. All the phases in the method can be transferred to industrial production processes. The films can be manufactured using devices that already exist in the industry, without the need for any major additional investment.VTT and Aalto University are applying for a patent for the production technology of NFC film. Trial runs and the related development work are performed at VTT.The nanofibrillated cellulose grade used was supplied by UPM.",Engelska nyheter

40949.5422685185,Reduced log export tariffs in Russia unlikely to boost export,"Feb 10 2012  Export tariffs on logs shipped from Russia are set to be reduced as the country becomes a member of the WTO. The proposed new lower tariffs are not expected to increase export volumes to pre-tariff levels, according to the Wood Resource Quarterly.","Log exports from Russia have plummeted the past five years mainly because of the country’s implementation of a log export tariff of 25 percent in 2008, as reported in the Wood Resource Qarterly. Despite having suffered a sharp decline in global market share, Russia is still the largest exporter of softwood logs in the world.When Russia was accepted into the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in December of 2011, one of the requirements for the entry into the organization was that the country had to reduce export and import tariffs on forest products. According to persons close to the negotiation process, the not yet official proposal for the amendment of the Russian log export tariff system will lower the tariffs on softwood logs from 25 to 15 percent for pine logs, and to 13 percent for spruce logs. The new proposed tariff for birch will actually be higher than the current tariffs for small diameter logs.In addition to the lowering of the tariffs, the proposal also includes a volume quota for softwood logs. Below the quota limit, the new tariffs will apply, and for volumes above the quota, current tariffs will continue to be in effect.The proposed quotas will almost certainly have no impact on trade with the EU, since they are set substantially higher than the volumes shipped in 2011, and are close to the record high levels of 2006.Over the past ten years, there have been three occasions when the annual shipments of pine logs have been higher than the quota volume, Wood Resource Quarterly writes.Even with a reduction in export taxes of twelve percent, it is not likely that foreign log buyers will rush back to Russia to purchase higher log volumes in the coming years, since the business climate in the country continues to be challenging in terms of political uncertainty, continued corruption, increasing domestic log costs and infrastructure problems.This uncertainty makes many forest companies wary about investing or trading with Russia, so they will likely try to diversify their timber sourcing further to include other regions.",Engelska nyheter

40960.3566435185,Wood fiber costs for pulp mills declined in the fourth quarter,"Feb 21 2012  Global demand for pulp has declined, and pulp prices fell during the second half of 2011. As a consequence, prices for wood fiber were down throughout the world, as reported by the Wood Resource Quarterly.","Global pulp prices fell by about 20 percent from July to December last year. In the fourth quarter of the year the global wood fiber indices for softwood and hardwood fiber declined 3.5 percent from the third quarter.There has been a long-term trend in the pulp industry of wood costs increasing as a percentage of the total production costs. In the third quarter of 2011, this share had reached 63.5 percent on a worldwide basis, up from only 53 percent in 2005, according to Fisher International. However, this share can vary substantially, from a current low of 52 percent in Eastern Canada to as high as 73 percent in China. For this reason, tracking wood fiber prices over time has become more important when comparing competitiveness of different regions worldwide, World Resource Quarterly writes.In the fourth quarter of 2011, the US Dollar continued to strengthen against the local currencies of all of the countries covered by the Wood Resource Quarterly except Japan. This development, together with the downward price pressure on pulplog and wood chips in local currencies resulted in a decline of both global wood fiber indices.The Softwood Wood Fiber Price Index fell for the second straight quarter to 105.30 Dollars per oven-dry tons (odmt) in the fourth quarter. This was down 3.3 percent from the previous quarter. The biggest price declines took place in Western Canada, Brazil, Spain, Germany and Finland.The Hardwood Wood Fiber Price Index fell by 3.6 percent to 113.69 Dollars per odmt. Despite this drop, this was the third highest level ever recorded. The biggest price reductions occurred in Spain, Finland, Brazil and Chile.Wood fiber costs are likely to continue downward in a number of markets in first quarter of 2012, particularly in the Nordic countries, Western Canada and the US, as pulp prices continue to be substantially below the record-high levels from last summer.",Engelska nyheter

As many as  eleven countries still have no such policy in place at all, despite having illegal timber in their supply chains, and monitoring of the quality of implementation is very weak.Unless EU governments do more, wood products sold across the EU could still be undermining social infrastructure and devastating natural habitats in areas of Indonesia and the Congo Basin.

40966.7292361111,Swedish researchers produce nanofibers made of sludge,"Feb 27 2012  Researchers from Luleå University of Technology have succeeded in recycling cellulose sludge for production of cellulose nanofibers, and have now proven it to be an economic and environmental success.","The yield of the manufacture of cellulose nanofibres from the sludge is 95 pecent, compared with cellulose nanofiber production from wood chips and lignin residues 48 percent.”This is definitely the best result we have had in producing nanofibers from different bio-residues. Presumably, this is a very profitable production, that cellulose industries should take an interest in,” said Kristiina Oksman, Professor at Luleå University of Technology.Cellulose nanofibers, manufactured from this sludge, are probably shorter than the cellulose  nanofibers made from pulp but are finer and can form dense films with excellent barrier properties.A few years ago, cellulose industries in Sweden, disposed some of their waste as sludge into the ocean. It is now prohibited, and the sludge is stored in large tanks on land. This particular cellulose sludge makes it possible to produce, so far, the most profitable production of cellulose nanofibers from bio-residue products.”The separation of cellulose nanofibers from bioresidues is energy demanding, but when we separate the waste from Domsjö pulp mill, the energy consumption is lower. The special cellulose from Domsjö has very small size and it also has high cellulose content and therefore the fibers do not need to be chemically pre-treated before the production of cellulose nanofibers,” Professor Oksman said.",Engelska nyheter

New business and service ecosystems must be developed. Bioeconomy has the prerequisites for becoming a successful example for Finnish business life. This will, however, require a functioning collaboration network and our own bioeconomy strategy,” Leppävuori said.According to expert assessment, by 2020 new technological solutions and diversification could, for example, raise Finland’s current forest industry production by six billion Euros (equal to an increase of 22 percent compared to 2010 level).Bioeconomy has all the prerequisites for creating a radical increase in the value of exports and for developing into a new pillar of support for wellbeing in Finland.

On a global scale, adjusting to these developments requires radical changes to production methods, to the use of raw materials, and to living habits in general. Bioeconomy provides an answer to many of these challenges, and creates new business,” Leppävuori said.”The forest industry, for example, can expand its current operations into the production of composites, biofuels and biochemicals, and into service businesses.

41022.3311342593,Loss in first quarter for Södra,April 20 2012  Södra's operating profit for the first quarter of 2012 amounted to -41 million Kronor. Reduced production and a number of market stoppages characterized the first quarter.,"“We started the year with most of our sawmills implementing market stoppages, while production at two of our Norwegian pulp mills was down for much of the quarter. Production at our pulp mills was just 73 per cent of our normal capacity. For the sawmills, the corresponding figure was a low 70 per cent,” said Leif Brodén, CEO of Södra.The pulp market started to show signs of recovery during the first quarter of 2012. The world market price of bleached softwood sulphate pulp went up as inventories decreased.“We are seeing a recovering pulp market and anticipating economic recovery,” said Brodén. Price announcements have been accepted, and as of 1 April the price of NSBK is USD 870 per tonne. We are now seeing strong increases in volumes to China, which up to now has been more or less solely responsible for the increase,"" Brodén said.Pulp production at Södra’s five mills over the period amounted to 380,000 tonnes, compared with 522,000 tonnes over the same period last year. This reduction is due to the market stoppages which took place at Södra Cell Tofte and Södra Cell Folla.Textile pulp is now being produced at Södra Cell Mörrum. Annual production is expected to reach 170,000 tonnes, which will give Södra a competitive textile pulp product based on hardwood.“For the rest of 2012, we will see normal capacity utilization, and we think we will see a profit for the year which is just below last year’s result, along with a seven to eight percent return on capital employed,” said Leif Brodén.",Engelska nyheter

However, the average price in Kronor during the first quarter was less than it was in the fourth quarter of 2011, rottneros writes in its first quarter report.Global stock levels for pulp are falling and deliveries of pulp to Asia are strong. There has simultaneously been a reduction in the cost of timber and electricity, which has a positive impact on margins, Rottneros writes.”The beginning of 2012 was significantly more stable than the end of 2011 from the perspective of a pulp supplier,” said Ole Terland, CEO of Rottneros. ”Strong deliveries to China, which started before and continued after the turn of the year, have altered the momentum of the global pulp market.

41023.0555208333,Promising research findings in carbon fiber from lignin,April 24 2012  Promising research findings with carbon fiber from lignin are presented in a new doctoral thesis by Swedish researcher Ida Norberg.,"Ida Norberg defended her doctoral thesis ""Carbon fibers from kraft lignin"" at Innventia in Stockholm. Her thesis shows that lignin has great potential for use as a raw material for manufacturing carbon fiber.Carbon fiber is strong and light, with many applications. Demand is mainly limited by the high cost of production, with the petroleum-based raw material and fiber spinning accounting for around 50 percent of the cost.Thanks to the LignoBoost technology, developed by Innventia, pulp mills can extract extremely pure lignin which could be used for carbon fiber, thus increasing access to a raw material for carbon fiber. According to studies reported on in Ida Norberg's thesis, the cost of production could also be lowered by using lignin.Ida Norberg carried out much of her doctoral work within the framework of the LigniCarb research project, with the aim of examining and demonstrating the possibilities of making carbon fiber from kraft lignin. One of the outcomes of this work was a brand new research environment at Innventia in Stockholm, where carbon fiber is now prepared on a laboratory scale.In her studies, Ida Norberg has compared lignin from hardwood (birch and eucalyptus) and softwood (a mixture of spruce and pine). One important conclusion is that the differences in the lignin are reflected in the carbon fiber process. Softwood lignin has proven to be harder to liquefy and spin, but once lignin fibers have been produced they are easier to use later on in the process. The opposite is true with hardwood.A major breakthrough came when the team succeeded in spinning fibers from softwood lignin. This had previously been thought impossible, but is of particular interest to the forest industry in the Nordic region and North America.",Engelska nyheter

41040.5380324074,Weaker forest industry production in Finland in first quarter,"May 11 2012  Difficult market conditions led to weaker forest industry production in Finland in early 2012, while timber sales were lively.","The Finnish forest industry's production environment was difficult in the first quarter, and demand for several product categories was sluggish in the main market areas.Finland produced 2.6 million tons of paper and paperboard in January-March 2012, down twelve percent from the corresponding period previous year. Consumption of graphic paper grades remained on a low level in Europe, the main market area, and this had an impact on Finnish production volumes. On the other hand, production of fine paper picked up pace towards the end of the quarter. The prices fetched by paper and paperboard products remained stable, when compared to the corresponding period of 2011.  Finland produced 1.7 million tons of pulp in January-March 2012, about the same amount as in the corresponding period of 2011. First-quarter pulp exports grew to 720,000 tons, up 28 percent from 2011.“Rapid action is needed to improve the cost-competitiveness of the forest industry in Finland. Finnish production units need to retain their vitality in an intensely competitive international market,” says Timo Jaatinen, Director General of the Finnish Forest Industries Federation.”New investments are needed to alter the situation, but they cannot be realised, unless domestic production factors, such as raw material, energy, logistics and labour costs, become competitive with our key rival countries,” Jaatinen says.Timber sales activity was brisk in the first quarter. The forest industry purchased 6.2 million cubic meters of wood in January-March, more than double the amount procured in the first quarter of 2011. Pulpwood procurements came to 3.2 million cubic meters. Damage from storms around the turn of the year spurred timber sales especially in January.

41069.864212963,Birch can provide renewable plastic raw material,"June 7 2012  Green modification of the natural polymer xylan improves a number of material properties, according to new licentiate thesis by Innventia researcher Johanna Persson.","A significant proportion of hardwood - up to 30 percent - consists of the hemicellulose xylan. Xylan is a natural polymer that is leached out from the fibres but not destroyed during kraft cooking. Xylan could therefore be used as a raw material for manufacturing barrier films for food packaging or other polymer materials.However, there are a number of difficulties when using xylan: It is water soluble, it is not thermally formable, and it is not easy to make films from. Swedish researcher Johanna Persson has taken on these challenges in her studies.""I took the fact that we can already produce xylan from black liquor as my starting point,"" she explains. ""Using chemical modification - an organic synthesis - I then tried to influence the hydrophilic, thermal and film-forming properties,"" Johanna Persson says.The modification involves grafting lactide, which is produced in plants, onto xylan, thereby creating branches - or side chains - of polylactide. The length of these chains determines the properties of the material.""The difficulty comes in controlling the length of these chains,"" continues Johanna Persson. ""An article I read led me to discover a catalyst (triazabicyclodecene) that has proven to be highly effective. We can now produce lactide-grafted xylan with a specific branch length, giving us a broad spectrum of different materials that can be processed thermally and are not soluble in water. We can also produce strong self-supporting films with a tensile strength of up to 48 MPa.""""Our use of 'green modification' may result in many new applications from renewable resources such as xylan,"" adds Olof Dahlman, who was Johanna Persson's supervisor at Innventia.",Engelska nyheter

Globally, economic growth is also expected to remain slow. As a result, METLA forecasts Finnish paper production and exports to drop by eight percent to 7.9 million tons and 7.3 million tons, respectively, this year from last year's levels.Paperboard demand, however, has remained reasonable despite the recession, METLA notes. It expects Finnish production and exports of paperboard to edge down by only one percent to 2.7 million tons and 2.5 million tons, respectively, this year, RISI reports.On the price side, METLA forecasts stability for both paper and paperboard prices this year, after increases of six and seven percent, respectively, in 2011.Finnish pulp production remained quite stable during the first quarter this year, while pulp exports rose by eight percent, RISI reports. METLA forecasts a seven percent increase in Finnish pulp exports this year to 2.4 million tons, as global demand will remain strong. Due to lower domestic paper production, the country's pulp output will drop by four percent to 6.5 million tons this year, according to METLA.METLA foresees a five percent decrease in Finnish kraft pulp export prices from the 2011 levels.Finland's Pellervo Economic Research institute published a forecast for 2012-2013 earlier this year, with somewhat more positive figures for production and export volumes and more negative price expectations for 2012, RISI reports.",Engelska nyheter

RISI reports.","The capacity curtailment will cover both newsprint and mechanical paper, but will focus more on newsprint and coated mechanical paper, where the firm sees a ""relatively weak"" demand situation, and less on supercalendered paper, where the situation remains ""okay,"" Sven Ombudstvedt, CEO of Norske Skog, told RISI.The temporary curtailments will be carried out in the third quarter, starting from July 1, but the duration of this process will depend on how the demand situation develops, he added.In Europe, Norske Skog has a capacity of some 1.3 million tons per year of newsprint and some 1.5 million tons per year of mechanical paper, almost evenly split between coated and uncoated mechanical paper.Permanent closures are not excluded, RISI reports. Sven Ombudstvedt said that the major capacity closures in newsprint and magazine paper made by UPM around the end of last year were obviously positive for the market, but that due to the financial situation in Europe, the market has unfortunately still not seen much effect from this.The same goes for Norske Skog's closure of its Follum mill at the end of the first quarter, according to Ombudstvedt.""This means that both we and other producers have to continue to look at permanent closures in the future,"" he said.Ombudstvedt did not comment on what permanent closures Norske Skog might make, but agreed that the company did, like many other producers, have more marginal production units as well.

Taking all necessary conversion measures into account, the entire investment has been amortized in just one year.At its Hagen site, Stora Enso produces almost half a million tons of paper per year. Close to 170,000 cubic meters of compressed air have to be generated every day to operate the paper machines, calendars, winders and cutters. Five compressors supply the internal compressed air system and cover the highly fluctuating demand, which at peak times can rise rapidly by up to 5,000 cubic meters per hour.In 2010, the company decided to optimize its compressed air system and installed an central controller, as well as a compressor from Atlas Copco.The ES 130 T controls several compressor sizes and types from various manufacturers. The system tests, stores and analyzes to ensure that the most suitable compressors are activated. As a result, the output of the five connected machines is geared, in terms of overall energy, towards achieving the optimum operating point and is continuously adjusted to meet the demand.Once the central controller and VSD compressor had been installed, Stora Ensa's energy consumption fell by 30 percent.

Compared to conventional calendering, the metal belt calendering technology enables manufacturing of paper and board with better surface smoothness at a desired level of stiffness and bulk, but using 3-10 percent less fibre raw material. In addition, it consumes less energy and yields higher production efficiency than other calendering concepts.Metal belt calandering is particularly suitable for low cost fibres such as recycled fibres and thus enables development of new cost-competitive paper and board products.“The metal belt technology has the potential to make a major positive impact on the industry and the environment. It can be seen as a platform technology which has the potential to radically change paper- and board-making concepts. We are also highly impressed by the strong breakthrough nature of the research, which I think stands out as an extraordinary example of “thinking out of the box”, said Marcus Wallenberg, Chairman of the Marcus Wallenberg Foundation at the award ceremony.Mika Viljanmaa was born in 1966 in Finland. He started his career in 1996 as a development engineer at Valmet Corporation (now Metso Paper), Järvenpää, Finland, where he also completed his Master’s thesis as a Helsinki University of Technology student.

41218.4478472222,The forest products industry must adjust its output ,2012-11-05 How willing is the forest products industry to adjust its output as demand for traditional paper products declines and profit margins shrink? The forest products industry has every reason to try to present new business. This was the message of a recent seminar organized by KSLA (The Royal Swedish Academy of Agriculture and Forestry).,"

“This is not a matter of the forest products industry being unwilling

to switch to new products. The industry recognizes that it will have to

adjust in order to survive in a globalized world economy. The question

is how the adjustment should be undertaken,” said university lecturer,

Lars Coenen, at Circle, a multi-disciplinary research center at Lund

University, whose primary focus is the study of innovation systems.

Lars Coenen focused his address on biorefineries and stated that it is

difficult for the forest products industry to invest in biorefineries

in its industrial processes. Erecting this costly, immature technology

is a challenge, to say the least. Competition from the petrochemical is

stiff. 

“The petrochemical industry is highly efficient. It possesses vast

industrial resources and considerable expertise. It has been in

operation for many decades and offers relatively inexpensive products.

Add to this the petrochemical industry’s lobbying and political

influence. 

Whether it involves the manufacture of products with low value content,

such as biofuel, or products with higher value content, such as

advanced materials, the forest products industry needs to have

strategies in place. 

“Innovative, concrete business models are needed to create an incentive

for researchers and investors to be willing to focus on a bio-based

economy. There are future visions, but there is uncertainty in terms of

how much biofuel and the type of biofuel that should be used. What

requirements are to be covered?” 

It is important that investors are aware of these challenges. 

“Should bio-products compete on the basis of price initially? Probably

not. Instead, one should take a look at the additional values that

these new products offer. There are consumers who are willing to pay a

little extra for eco-friendly products, just as they are prepared to

pay a little more for ecological food.”

However, most consumers are not similarly inclined and, moreover,

regulations and means of control are needed to support bio-based

products. 

A standardization of bio-products would also clarify the requirements

for the industry. Public procurement of products is an under-used

instrument in driving the development of bio-products from the

forest-products industry and one that would offer the industry the

necessary economies of scale.

What remains is to find the optimal way for the forest products industry to organize its efforts. 

Does this require integration with other companies, an approach that is

successfully applied by the chemical industry in its development work,

or does it involve working in clusters? 

“In any case, the approach should definitely not be to work alone, but

instead to cooperate with companies and industries in various value

chains that are linked to new bio-based products,” noted Lars Coenen.",Engelska nyheter

In the years immediately ahead, gradual price increases are forecast for NBSK, with ultimately very high levels, according to the Nordic Paper Journal. ","Calejo Pulp Futures predicted, with very good timing, the fateful

financial crisis in 2009. And when most other market analysts last

autumn indicated continuing high levels of pulp prices, Calejo turned

to the Swedish and international media to warn of a new trend reversal

during late summer 2011 with declining pulp prices – which actually

occurred. This was an insight that Calejo’s customers had already

41218.4506597222,EU Commission favors forest residue as biofuel ,2012-11-05 The EU Commission is of the opinion that biofuel should only receive financial support if it leads to considerably reduced greenhouse gas emissions and is not produced using potential food crops. The favored sources include forest residue. ,"

The EU Commission has presented a proposal designed to encourage

biofuel that contributes to “major reductions in emissions” and that

does not compete with food production. Only 5 percent of biofuel based

on food crops will be permitted to be included in the climate targets

for the transport sector up to 2020, the Commission proposes. 

Gustav Melin, CEO at the Swedish Bioenergy Association, Svebio, tells

the Nordic Paper Journal that the proposal will not lead to emission

reductions. Quite the contrary! 

“It rests on poor foundations and would sharply reduce the development

of biofuels, thereby leading to higher consumption of gasoline and

diesel.” 

However, the aim of the proposal is to stimulate the development of biofuel from non-food crops? 

“In the spring, the EU Agricultural Directive made a proposal

concerning 7 percent “green” fallow in an effort to favor environmental

measures on arable land. One of the reasons for the proposal is that we

have too much land devoted to meeting current food requirements. In

other words, it is erroneous to claim that cultivation for bio-energy

purposes leads to food shortages.

 “We grow the food that somebody wishes to buy. Unfortunately, those

who are starving have no money to cover their demand for food. In other

words, there’s no problem in growing more food to meet a greater demand

for food,” adds Gustaf.

 “If biofuel is to assist us in our efforts to counter climate change,

we must use biofuel that really is sustainable long-term. We must

invest in biofuel that really reduces emissions and does not compete

with food. Needless to say, this does not entail a stop for the first

biofuel generation, but we want to send a clear signal that future

biofuel must be advanced biofuel. Anything else is unsustainable,”

41225.6805671296,Power boost from paper machine ,"2012-11-12 At the 2012 Tissue Maker conference, spontaneous applause erupted before the end of the presentation of a turbine that captures the jet blast of a paper machine and converts it to electrical energy. More than half of the energy of the jet blast in the headbox can be recycled, according to pilot tests conducted by Metso.","An energy saving of more than 50 percent of the jet blast could

represent significant savings for many tissue manufacturers. Several

participants at the Tissue Maker conference promptly began asking

questions, such as whether the technology could also be used on

existing machines. “We have to determine that on a case-by-case basis,” answered

Karl-Johan Tolfsson, Manager of Metso Tissue Technology Center in

Karlstad. “It depends on whether the machine has sufficient space to

fit the turbine.”

No disruption to operations

The turbine is placed just after the headbox and forming section, and

captures the jet blast from what is known as a Banki turbine, whereby

water passes through the turbine and generates energy at both the

infeed and outflow phases. The Banki turbine is often used in

small-but-fast water flows and has the advantage of high reliability.

The turbine is connected to a generator and the electricity produced is

then passed back to the machine’s drive units.

The jet blast is led to the turbine through a guiding plate, which can

be reset so that the water flows past the turbine while operation

continues normally. The design engineers have thus also created a

solution that enables the maintenance of the turbine without any

disruptions to production.

Tissue Maker 2012 was held in mid-September in Karlstad. A considerable

amount of development has taken place at Metso’s Tissue Technology

Center in Karlstad, the place where the pilot machine is located and

where the technology was tested, and where the project’s target of

recycling more than 50 percent of the energy from the jet blast was

achieved. 

The Banki turbine was chosen in consultation with development engineers

at Vattenfall, which uses the technology in unmanned power plants where

electric power is generated in minor watercourses.

To harness the maximum amount of energy, it is vital to remove as much

of the air as possible that has been mixed with the water in the

forming section. This is one of the purposes of the guiding plate and

Metso’s pilot tests have indicated a removal of approximately 80

percent of the air from the water. (Greenindustry and Papernet)",Engelska nyheter

41247.5788425926,Heat and pressure form new all-cellulose composite material,"2012-12-04 On 30 of November, Helena Halonen defended her doctoral

thesis “Structural changes during cellulose composite processing”. Her

work demonstrates two methods for creating a new composite material

based only on cellulose fibres.","In a composite material, the reinforcing agent and the matrix must adhere well at the interface; any effect can reduce the strengthening effect. Using components composed of the same material, as in all-cellulose composites, the adhesion at the interface is expected to be improved. In addition, this construction would improve the recyclability of the material.In her thesis, Helena Halonen presents a production method that entails more advantages including low cost, simplicity and relatively predictability. The method involves the use of existing raw materials, i.e. pulps that are already available from the pulp mills. Biocomposites based on chemical pulp or dissolving pulp are processed via compression moulding, a commonly used technique found in nearly all industrial sectors. It would therefore be relatively easy to implement the method in an industrial installation.The experiments show that the optimum press temperature would be 170 °C in order to achieve fast drying without the material being broken down thermally, while still having excellent mechanical properties.The thesis also describes a method for producing biocomposites based on bacterial cellulose fibril aggregates from Gluconacetobacter xylinusprocessed through a biosynthesis. The formation of cellulose fibrils was affected by the addition of hydroxyetylcellulose (HEC) which resulted in a biocomposite with remarkable mechanical properties including improved strength, modulus and toughness. The HEC coating improved the fibril dispersion and prevented fractures.(Innventia)",Engelska nyheter

41254.6087037037,Too small Swedish presence in Asia,"2012-12-11 The paper industry is facing challenges as global volumes of printing paper are in steady decline. New capacities of paper grades, including premium and liquid packaging board, are coming on stream in China – this is likely to make exports to China from Europe increasingly diffcult, according to Peter Lennhag, Asia Pacific Executive Advisors.","Most leading Swedish paper companies still have only a small presence

in Asia. Far too many rely on trading companies to carry out their

business across Asia. For SCA, only 2.2% of total sales are from Asia.

In 2011, ten major Swedish companies had more than 25% of their total

sales in Asia Pacific. No paper companies included. Unfortunately far

too many do not yet have a strong position in Asia – making it

impossible for them to benefit from the high market growth in this

region. Peter Lennhag believe that companies who fail to participate in Asia’s growth face major risks as they are likely to become increasingly marginalized within their industries.

41256.4669907407,VTT wins innovation prize for a new bio-oil production technique,"2012-12-13 VTT Technical Research Centre, Fortum, Metso and UPM, has developed a technique that enables the cogeneration of heating energy and bio-oil in the same power plant cost-effectively and sustainably. VTT’s technique is based on combining pyrolysis and fluidised bed technology. Thanks to the new technique, bio-oil production volumes can be expected to increase considerably in the next few decades. Now VTT received an innovation award for the new technology. ","

The use of bio-oil has significant positive effects on the environment.

By replacing fossil fuels with bio-oil in heat generation, carbon

dioxide emissions can be cut by 70–90 per cent. Sulphur emissions are

also considerably lower.Bio-oil has for a long time been pegged as the successor of fossil

fuels as our future source of energy. However, large-scale commercial

use of bio-oil in heat generation requires a cost-effective production

technique. The new technique enables a considerable cut in the

production cost of bio-oil.



Fast pyrolysis involves heating biomass such as forest industry waste

to a high temperature to form gas. When the gas is cooled, it condenses

into liquid known as bio-oil. Combining the pyrolysis process with

traditional fluidised bed boilers used in power plants brings a range

of efficiency gains. Producing bio-oil with the new technique is

cheaper than in a separate pyrolysis process. Bio-oil plants that are

integrated into power plants are extremely energy-efficient, because

the energy contained in the by-products of the pyrolysis process can be recovered in fluidised bed boilers. The innovation award for the new technology was distributed in December by the European Association for

Research and Technology Organisations EARTO. EARTO wants to reward

innovations that have significant societal and economic impact. ",Engelska nyheter

Twaron technology enabled improved performance, and an industrially scalable production method. That makes it possible to find applications for CNT fibers in a range of commercial or industrial products. ","For several years leading researchers at Rice University, including

Nobel prize winner in Chemistry 1996, Mr Richard Smalley, along with

researchers at Teijin Aramid, have been working on producing carbon

nanotubes and forming them into useful macroscopic objects with

extraordinary, new performance properties.

For the first time in history, it has been possible to spin carbon

nanotubes (CNTs) into a super fiber that has very high thermal and

electrical conductivity and good textile performance. Carbon nanotubes,

the building blocks of the fiber, which is as thin as a strand of DNA,

combine the best properties of thermal and electrical conductivity,

strength, modulus and flexibility.To spin a high-performance carbon nanotube textile thread (fiber), the

nanotubes must be perfectly stacked and orientated along the fiber

axis. The most efficient method to produce this high performance fiber

is to dissolve CNTs in a super acid, followed by wet-spinning. This is

a patented process which has been used since the 1970s in spinning

","In the 3Q/12, total shipments were up 70 percent year-over-year to 860 000 tons. The growth is expected to continue with numerous plans for adding capacity.

Beyond the trade statistics tracking the rise of pellet export volumes, another spate of export pellet plant announcements emphasized the quickly growing trade

relations that are being established between European power utilities

and US pellet producers. The most striking announcement came in mid-December when Drax, a United Kingdom power company, stated its

intention to build two 450,000 tons pellet plants, one in the state of

Louisiana and one in Mississippi.

The three major European pellet import countries remain the UK, the Netherlands, and Belgium, while Italy, Denmark and Sweden are notably involved in pellet imports from North America, but on a much smaller scale. Denmark’s Dong Energy utility, however, announced its intentions to switch to woody biomass at three of its coal plants, an action likely to add demand from the US Southeast, according to Wood Fiber Review.",Engelska nyheter
41303.5659606482,Innventia Global Outlook Report: The global consumer demand smarter packaging ,"2013-01-29 Global consumers are guided by product packaging in their buying behaviour, not least in India. We reject products in plastic packaging and feel guilty when we throw away plastic water bottles. We worry about the amount of packaging consumed by society, and when shopping online we might consider having goods delivered in simple standard packaging instead of the original packaging if it makes them cheaper. These are the results of an international study by Innventia, Packaging 2020, carried out in association with Kairos Future.","The report describes seven global forces and their impact on the

packaging industry and the packaging of the future. The conclusions are

based on a survey carried out among consumers in the US, India and

Sweden. A clear majority of the 1,500 respondents see major problems

with society's consumption of packaging.

There are demands for tougher quality controls and stricter

environmental legislation, and a clear majority of consumers in all

three countries would like to see somewhat stricter or much stricter

environmental legislation.Some examples: 56 percent of consumers in India say that recycling is extremely

important to them, compared to 32 percent in Sweden and 37 percent in

the US.When shopping online, 94 percent of Swedes would consider paying less

for goods delivered in simple standard packaging instead of the

original packaging.20 percent of Swedish consumers worry very often about packaging

containing harmful substances. The corresponding figure in India is 43

percent.65 percent of Swedish consumers think that plastic is the least environmentally friendly material, compared with 47 percent for aluminium and 4 percent for paper (multiple answers were possible). In India, 30 percent think that paper is the least environmentally friendly material.

"" A growing global middle class, an aging population, limited access to

raw materials and intensified urbanisation are a few of the megatrends

posing challenges for the product and packaging industry,” says Fredrik

Rosén, Manager of the Market and Consumer Insight group at Innventia.

“We’re seeing purchasing decisions being guided by the packaging

material itself, not just the appearance of the packaging. We’re also

seeing a clear demand and a great need for smarter packaging. In the

future, stricter demands will be placed on packaging materials that

come into contact with foodstuffs.",Engelska nyheter

The fibre has been named Olea.","Thanks to incorporation of the additive during the spinning process, the hydrophobic effect is durable and cannot be washed out.Olea fibres are suitable for demanding hygiene and food applications as the additive is FDA approved. At the same time, Kelheim Fibres is testing Olea for textile applications. The unique combination of hydrophobic properties and the typical excellent moisture management and wearer comfort of viscose fibres are very promising, especially for sportswear and other functional textile applications, according to the company.In contrast to other methods of creating hydrophobic properties, Kelheim has been able to maintain the typical properties of the viscose fibre by incorporating the hydrophobicity in the fibre matrix itself.""Olea is an environmentally friendly alternative for the cover- and back-sheets of hygiene products - for example nappies, sanitary towels or incontinence pads: In order to protect the wearer's skin, these sheets need to remain dry while they facilitate the transport of liquid away from the skin"", says Dr. Philipp Wimmer from Kelheim's R&D team.Kelheim's range of viscose specialities now covers the two poles of absorbency performance - from the hydrophobic Olea fibre to viscose fibres with water retention up to more than 400% - and so offers a comprehensive choice for the nonwovens industry.",Engelska nyheter

41324.5914351852,Solar economy: Solar cells on paper from Swedish mills,2012-02-19 Selected parts of the Swedish paper industry are set to receive a request for proposals to manufacture third-generation solar cells printed on paper.,"NLAB Solar, the company that has filed a patent for the production of

opaque solar cells that can be printed on, for example, paper-like

material, now hopes to be able to utilize the paper industry’s

processes.

NLAB Solar’s President, Giovanni Fili, tells Nordic Paper Journal that

the ambition is to use the processes and know-how found in traditional

Swedish industry to launch the solar cells across the globe.

“The business concept is to export production facilities on license

while retaining strategic research centers in Sweden,” says Fili,

holding up a solar cell the size of an iPad.

The product in question is referred to as Dye Sensitized Solar Cells,

which unlike siliconbased solar cells, does not need to be exposed to

direct sunlight in order to be efficient. They generate energy in hazy

and overcast weather conditions because they are based on dyed titanium

dioxide instead of using silicone as the semiconductor. They can

therefore be customized to suit the light conditions and temperatures

in which they will be deployed, meaning that they can also be used

indoors.Håkan Envall, Enwall Consulting and Giovanni Fili, NLAB Solar,  hope to be able to utilize the paper industry’s

processes.According to Giovanni Fili, we could be on the threshold of a revolution.

Solar cells can now be made as thin as 0.05 millimeters and NLAB Solar

can print an extremely thin film of the photovoltaic material in a

multi-layer structure comprising five to ten solar cells using

conventional screen printing methods.

Because the solar cells are printed on plastic or foil, the weight per

square meter is only about 400 grams, but there is almost no limit to

the material upon which the solar cells can be printed. And we could be

seeing even smaller solar cells if it is now possible to print on

paper-like material.

The technology could considerably reduce electricity costs per generated watt while also increasing power output.",Engelska nyheter

decreased by up to 1% when compared to the previous year, with total

output of approximately 38 million tonnes. It is estimated that output

of market pulp increased by about between 4% and 4.5%, while integrated

pulp output decreased by 3% in 2012 when compared to 2011.It is estimated that consumption of paper for recycling by CEPI members fell by between 1% and 1.5%.

41361.4161111111,Paper machine in Skogn threatened with closure,"2013-03-28 Norske Skog is temporarily suspending production of newsprint at PM2 in Skogn, Norway. However, the closure could be made permanent.","The paper machine that Norske Skog is temporarily closing is relatively small. Annual production of PM2 in Skogn is only about 150 000 tons of newsprint of the mill’s total annual capacity of 550 000 tons.According to Norske Skog, the hope is that a temporary closure of the line will yield an improved balance between supply and demand.However, it is not beyond the realms of possibility that the paper machine will be permanently shut down. Norske Skog has told Nordic Paper Journal that it has exhausted all other possibilities to commence production of other paper grades in the paper machine. - We are continuously monitoring whether or not to permanently close the papermachine. Our decision is entirely dependent on market developments, says Carsten Dybevig, Vice President Corporate Affairs to Nordic Paper Journal.Export of paper from PM2 is mainly destined for the UK market.Demand for the products is weak and the Norwegian Krone is strong, which are the factors behind the temporary closure of the line. Should prices rise, Norske Skog will be able to improve profitability on the line, but this remains to be seen.Norske Skog is also cutting back production by 15,000 tons at the company’s only paper machine in New Zealand. This is the result of increased energy costs, according to Norske Skog.",Engelska nyheter

41366.5053819444,Major challenges lurking in the forest,"2013-04-02 Forest industry CEOs fear overcapacity and cost savings, according to a report compiled by PriceWaterhouseCoopers on the global forest industry - CEO Survey FPP 2013.","Some 92 percent of the sector’s CEOs indicated in the report that their

companies had implemented a cost-reduction initiative in the past 12

months. Almost as many – 89 percent – plan to put one into action within the next year. These figures are higher than any other sector examined by PwC.

As a consequence of these measures, workforce reductions will be made. In 2013, one in five CEOs is planning to cut back on personnel. While the period immediately ahead appears challenging, there are some glimpses of light in the  longer perspective. At the same time as company heads are less optimistic about 2013 than their counterparts in other industries, they are actually more optimistic in the long-term. Indeed, 53 percent are confident that there will be growth within a timescale of three years. The report also indicated that three of four CEOs in the industry believe that energy and raw-material costs could threaten growth, which is a significantly higher figure than the sector average.

Half of the company executives say that they will increase investment in raw material supply in the next three years, and believe that Africa and Latin America will become ever more important in terms of access to raw materials. This confirmed by the growing number of industry players establishing operations in these regions.

When the CEOs are asked to state their three investment priorities, enhancing operational efficiency topped the list. R&D and innovation together with strategic alliances shared second place.

The report concluded by stating that innovation will play a decisive role in the new business models of the industry and that we will also see new forms of collaboration within and outside the sector.

Facts: PwC’s report was based on interviews with 49 CEO, from 23 countries in the forestry and paper industry.",Engelska nyheter
